<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The most prominent imaginative writer of the latest
generation in Italy is a woman. What little is known of
the private life of Matilde Serao (Mme. Scarfoglio) adds,
as forcibly as what may be divined from the tenour and
material of her books, to the impression that every
student of literary history must have formed of the difficulties
which hem in the intellectual development of an
ambitious girl. Without unusual neglect, unusual misfortune,
it seems impossible for a woman to arrive at
that experience which is essential to the production of
work which shall be able to compete with the work of
the best men. It is known that the elements of hardship
and enforced adventure have not been absent from the
career of the distinguished Italian novelist. Madame
Serao has learned in the fierce school of privation what
she teaches to us with so much beauty and passion in her
stories.</p>

<p>Matilde Serao was born on the 17th of March 1856, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the little town of Patras, on the western coast of Greece.
Her father, Francisco Serao, was a Neapolitan political
exile, her mother a Greek princess, the last survivor of
an ancient noble family. I know not under what circumstances
she came to the Italian home of her father, but
it was probably in 1861 or soon afterwards that the unification
of Italy permitted his return. At an early age,
however, she seems to have been left without resources.
She received a rough education at the Scuola Normale
in Naples, and she obtained a small clerkship in the
telegraph office at Rome.</p>

<p>Literature, however, was the profession she designed
to excel in, and she showed herself a realist at once.
Her earliest story, if I do not mistake, was that minute
picture of the vicissitudes of a post-office which is
named <cite>Telegraphi dello Stato</cite> ("State Telegraphs").
She worked with extreme energy, she taught herself
shorthand, and in 1878 she quitted the post-office to
become a reporter and a journalist. To give herself
full scope in this new employment, she, as I have
been assured, cut short her curly crop of hair, and
adopted on occasion male costume. She soon gained a
great proficiency in reporting, and advanced to the
writing of short sketches and stories for the newspapers.
The power and originality of these attempts were acknowledged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
and the name of Matilde Serao gradually became
one of those which irresistibly attracted public attention.
The writer of these lines may be permitted to record the
impression which more than ten years ago was made
upon him by reading a Neapolitan sketch, signed by
that then wholly obscure name, in a chance number of
the Roman <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fanfulla</i>.</p>

<p>The short stories were first collected in a little volume
in 1879. In 1880 Matilde Serao became suddenly
famous by the publication of the charming story <cite>Fantasia</cite>
("Fantasy"), which has already been presented to an
English public in the present series of translations. It
was followed by a much weaker study of Neapolitan life,
<cite>Cuore Infermo</cite> ("A Heart Diseased"). In 1881 she
published "The Life and Adventures of Riccardo
Joanna," to which she added a continuation in 1885.
It is not possible to enumerate all Madame Serao's
successive publications, but the powerful romance, <cite>La
Conquista di Roma</cite> ("The Conquest of Rome"), 1882,
must not be omitted. This is a very careful and highly
finished study of bureaucratic ambition, admirably characterised.
Since then she has written in rapid succession
several volumes of collected short stories, dealing with
the oddities of Neapolitan life, and a curious novel,
"The Virtue of Cecchina," 1884. Her latest romances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
most of them short, have been <cite>Terno Secco</cite> ("A Dry
Third"), a very charming episode of Italian life, illustrating
the frenzied interest taken in the public lotteries,
1887; <cite>Addio Amore</cite> ("Farewell Love!"), 1887, which
is here, for the first time, published in English; <cite>La
Granda Fiamma</cite>, 1889; and <cite>Sogno di una notte d'estate</cite>
("A Summer Night's Dream"), 1890.</p>

<p>The method of Matilde Serao's work, its qualities and
its defects, can only be comprehended by those who
realise that she came to literature through journalism.
When she began life, in 1878, it was as a reporter, a
paragraph-writer, a woman of all work on any Roman or
Neapolitan newspaper which would give her employment.
Later on, she founded and carried on a newspaper
of her own, the <cite>Corriere di Roma</cite>. After publishing
this lively sheet for a few years, she passed to Naples,
and became the editor of <cite>Le Corriere di Napoli</cite>, the
paper which enjoys the largest circulation of any journal
in the south of Italy. She has married a journalist,
Eduardo Scarfoglio, and all her life has been spent in
ministering to the appetites of the vast, rough crowd that
buys cheap Italian newspapers. Her novels have been
the employment of her rare and broken leisure; they
bear the stamp of the more constant business of her
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The naturalism of Matilde Serao deserves to be distinguished
from that of the French contemporaries with
whom she is commonly classed. She has a fiercer passion,
more of the true ardour of the South, than Zola or Maupassant,
but her temperament is distinctly related to that
of Daudet. She is an idealist working in the school
of realism; she climbs, on scaffolding of minute prosaic
observation, to heights which' are emotional and often
lyrical. But her most obvious merit is the acuteness
with which she has learned to collect and arrange in
artistic form the elements of the town life of Southern
Italy. She still retains in her nature something of the
newspaper reporter's quicksilver, but it is sublimated by
the genius of a poet.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<p>Motionless under the white coverlet of her bed,
Anna appeared to have been sleeping soundly for
the past two hours.</p>

<p>Her sister Laura, who occupied a little cot at
the other end of the big room, had that evening
much prolonged her customary reading, which
followed the last gossip of the day between the
girls. But no sooner had she put out her candle
than Anna opened her eyes and fixed them upon
Laura's bed, which glimmered vaguely white in
the distance.</p>

<p>Anna was wide awake.</p>

<p>She dared not move, she dared not even sigh;
and all her life was in her gaze, trying to penetrate
the secret of the dusk&mdash;trying to see whether really
her sister was asleep. It was a winter's night, and
as the hour advanced the room became colder and
colder; but Anna did not feel it.</p>

<p>The moment the light had been extinguished a
flame had leapt from her heart to her brain, diffusing
itself through all her members, scalding her
veins, scorching her flesh, quickening the beating
of her pulses. As in the height of fever, she felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
herself burning up; her tongue was dry, her head
was hot; and the icy air that entered her lungs
could not quench the fire in her, could not subdue
the tumultuous irruption of her young blood.</p>

<p>Often, to relieve herself, she had longed to cry
out, to moan; but the fear of waking Laura held
her silent. It was not, however, so much from
the great heat throbbing at her temples that she
suffered, as from her inability to know for certain
whether her sister was asleep.</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought of moving noisily, so
that her bed should creak; then if Laura was
awake, she would move in hers, and thus Anna
could make sure. But the fear of thereby still
further lengthening this time of waiting, kept her
from letting the thought become an action. She
lay as motionless as if her limbs were bound down
by a thousand chains.</p>

<p>She had lost all track of time, too; she had
forgotten to count the last strokes of the clock&mdash;the
clock that could be heard from the sitting-room
adjoining. It seemed to her that she had
been lying like this for years, that she had been
waiting for years, burning with this maddening
fire for years, that she had spent years trying to
pierce the darkness with her eyes.</p>

<p>And then the horrible thought crossed her
mind&mdash;What if the hour had passed? Perhaps
it had passed without her noticing it; she
who had waited for it so impatiently had let it
escape.</p>

<p>But no. Presently, deadened by the distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and the doors closed between, she heard the clock
ring out.</p>

<p>The hour had come.</p>

<p>Thereupon, with an infinite caution, born of
infinite fear, slowly, trembling, holding her breath
at every sound, pausing, starting back, going on,
she sat up in bed, and at last slipped out
of it.</p>

<p>That vague spot of whiteness in the distance,
where her sister lay, still fascinated her; she kept
her head turned in its direction, while with her
hands she felt for her shoes and stockings and
clothes. They were all there, placed conveniently
near; but every little difficulty she had to overcome
in dressing, so as not to make the slightest
noise, represented a world of precautions, of pauses,
and of paralysing fears.</p>

<p>When at last she had got on her frock of white
serge, which shone out in the darkness, "Perhaps
Laura sees me," she thought.</p>

<p>But she had made ready a big heavy black
shawl, and in this she now wrapped herself from
head to foot, and the whiteness of her frock was
hidden.</p>

<p>Then, having accomplished the miracle of dressing
herself, she stood still at her bedside; she
had not dared to take a step as yet, sure that by
doing so she would wake Laura.</p>

<p>"A little strength&mdash;Heaven send me a little
strength," she prayed inwardly.</p>

<p>Then she set forth stealthily across the room.
In the middle of it, seized by a sudden audacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
impulse, she called her sister's name, in a whisper,
"Laura, Laura," listening intensely.</p>

<p>No answer. She went on, past the door,
through the sitting-room, the drawing-room, feeling
her way amidst the chairs and tables. She
struck her shoulder against the frame of the
door between the sitting-room and the drawing-room,
and halted for a moment, with a beating
heart.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madonna mia! Madonna mia!</i>" she murmured
in an agony of terror.</p>

<p>Then she had to pass before the room of her
governess, Stella Martini; but the poor, good lady
was a sound sleeper, and Anna knew it.</p>

<p>When she reached the dining-room, it seemed
to her that she must have traversed a hundred
separate chambers, a hundred entire apartments,
an endless chain of chambers and apartments.</p>

<p>At last she opened the door that gave upon the
terrace, and ran out into the night, the cold, the
blackness. She crossed the terrace to the low
dividing-wall between it and the next.</p>

<p>"Giustino&mdash;Giustino," she called.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shadow of a man appeared on the
other terrace, very near, very close to the wall of
division.</p>

<p>A voice answered: "Here I am, Anna."</p>

<p>But she, taking his hand, drew him towards her,
saying: "Come, come."</p>

<p>He leapt over the little wall.</p>

<p>Covered by her black mantle, without speaking,
Anna bent her head and broke into sobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it? What is wrong?" he asked, trying
to see her face.</p>

<p>Anna wept without answering.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, don't cry. Tell me what's
troubling you," he murmured earnestly, with a
caress in his words and in his voice.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing. I was so frightened," she
stammered.</p>

<p>"Dearest, dearest, dearest!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a poor creature&mdash;a poor thing," said
she, with a desolate gesture.</p>

<p>"I love you so," said Giustino, simply, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, say that again," she begged, ceasing to
weep.</p>

<p>"I love you so, Anna."</p>

<p>"I adore you&mdash;my soul, my darling."</p>

<p>"If you love me, you must be calm."</p>

<p>"I adore you, my dearest one."</p>

<p>"Promise me that you won't cry any more,
then."</p>

<p>"I adore you, I adore you, I adore you!" she
repeated, her voice heavy with emotion.</p>

<p>He did not speak. It seemed as if he could
find no words fit for responding to such a passion.
A cold gust of wind swept over them.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No: feel." And she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>Her little hand, between those of Giustino, was
indeed not cold; it was burning.</p>

<p>"That is love," said she.</p>

<p>He lifted the hand gently to his lips, and kissed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
it lightly. And thereupon, her eyes glowed in the
darkness, like human stars of passion.</p>

<p>"My love is consuming me," she went on, as if
speaking to herself. "I can feel nothing else;
neither cold, nor night, nor danger&mdash;nothing. I
can only feel <em>you</em>. I want nothing but your love.
I only want to live near you always&mdash;till death, and
after death&mdash;always with you&mdash;always, always."</p>

<p>"Ah me!" sighed he, under his breath.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" she cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>"It was a sigh, dear one; a sigh over our
dream."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that; don't say that," she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I say it, Anna? The sweet
dream that we have been dreaming together&mdash;any
day we may have to wake from it. They aren't
willing that we should live together."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;they?"</p>

<p>"He who can dispose of you as he wishes,
Cesare Dias."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; to-day."</p>

<p>"And he won't consent?"</p>

<p>"He won't consent."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because you have money, and I have none.
Because you are noble, and I'm not."</p>

<p>"But I adore you, Giustino."</p>

<p>"That matters little to your guardian."</p>

<p>"He's a bad man."</p>

<p>"He's a man," said Giustino, shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's an act of cruelty that he's committing,"
she cried, lifting her hands towards heaven.</p>

<p>Giustino did not speak.</p>

<p>"What did you answer? What did you
plead? Didn't you tell him again that you
love me, that I adore you, that I shall die if we
are separated? Didn't you describe our despair
to him?"</p>

<p>"It was useless," replied Giustino, sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! You didn't tell him of
our love, of our happiness? You didn't implore
him, weeping? You didn't try to move his hard
old heart? But what sort of man are you; what
sort of soul have you, that you let them sentence
us to death like this? O Lord! O Lord!&mdash;what
man have I been loving?"</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna!" he said, softly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you defy him? Why didn't you
rebel? You're young; you're brave. How could
Cesare Dias, almost an old man, with ice in his
veins, how could he frighten you?"</p>

<p>"Because Cesare Dias was right, Anna," he
answered quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, horror! Horrible sacrilege of love!" cried
Anna, starting back.</p>

<p>In her despair she had unconsciously allowed
her shawl to drop from her shoulders; it had
fallen to the ground, at her feet. And now she
stood up before him like a white, desolate phantom,
impelled by sorrow to wander the earth on a
quest that can never have an end.</p>

<p>But he had a desperate courage, though it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
forced him to break with the only woman he had
ever loved.</p>

<p>"Cesare Dias was right, my dearest Anna. I
couldn't answer him. I'm a poor young fellow,
without a farthing."</p>

<p>"Love is stronger than money."</p>

<p>"I am a commoner, I have no title to give
you."</p>

<p>"Love is stronger than a title."</p>

<p>"Everything is against our union, Anna."</p>

<p>"Love is stronger than everything; stronger
even than death."</p>

<p>After this there befell a silence. But he felt
that he must go to the bottom of the subject.
He saw his duty, and overcame his pain.</p>

<p>"Think a little, Anna. Our souls were made
for each other; but our persons are placed in
such different circumstances, separated by so
many things, such great distances, that not even
a miracle could unite them. You accuse me of
being a traitor to our love, which is our strength;
but is it unworthy of us to conquer ourselves in
such a pass? Anna, Anna, it is I who lose
everything; and yet I advise you to forget this
youthful fancy. You are young; you are beautiful;
you are rich; you are noble, and you love
me; yet it is my duty to say to you, forget me&mdash;forget
me. Consider how great the sacrifice is,
and see if it is not our duty, as two good people,
to make it courageously. Anna, you will be
loved again, better still, by a better man. You
deserve the purest and the noblest love. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
won't be unhappy long. Life is still sweet for
you. You weep, yes; you suffer; because you
love me, because you are a dear, loving woman.
But afterwards, afterwards you will find your path
broad and flowery. It is I who will have nothing
left; the light of my life will go out, the fire in
my heart. But what does it matter? You will
forget me, Anna."</p>

<p>Anna, motionless, listened to him, uttering no
word.</p>

<p>"Speak," he said, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I can't forget you," she answered.</p>

<p>"Try&mdash;make the effort. Let us try not to see
each other."</p>

<p>"No, no; it's useless," she said, her voice
dying on her lips.</p>

<p>"What do you wish us to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't know."</p>

<p>A great impulse of pity, greater than his own
sorrow, assailed him. He took her hands; they
were cold now.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. She leant her head on
his shoulder, and he caressed her rich, brown
hair.</p>

<p>"Anna, what is it?" he whispered, thrilled by
a wild emotion.</p>

<p>"You don't love me."</p>

<p>"How can you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"If you loved me," she began, sobbing, "you
would not propose our separation. If you loved
me you would not think such a separation possible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
If you loved me it would be like death to
you to forget and be forgotten. Giustino, you
don't love me."</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna!"</p>

<p>"Judge by me," she went on, softly. "I'm a
poor, weak woman; yet I resist, I struggle. And we
would conquer, we would conquer, if you loved me."</p>

<p>"Anna!"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't call my name; don't speak my
name. All this tenderness&mdash;what's the use of it?
It is good; it is wise; it is comforting. But it is
only tenderness; it isn't love. You can think,
reflect, determine. That isn't love. You speak
of duty, of being worthy&mdash;worthy of her who
adores you, who sees nothing but you in the
whole wide world. I know nothing of all that.
I love you. I know nothing. And only now I
realise that your love isn't love. You are silent.
I don't understand you. You can't understand
me. Good-bye, love!"</p>

<p>She turned away from him, to move off. But
he detained her.</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"If I can't live with you, I must die," she said,
quietly, with her eyes closed, as if she were thus
awaiting death.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of dying, Anna. Don't make
my regret worse than it is. It's I who have
spoiled your life."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"It's I who have put bitterness into your sweet
youth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"It's I who have stirred you up to rebel against
Cesare Dias, against your sister Laura, against the
wish of your parents and all your friends."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"It is I who have called you from your sleep,
who have exposed you to a thousand dangers.
Think, if you were discovered here you would be
lost."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. Take me away."</p>

<p>And Giustino, in spite of the darkness, could see
her fond eyes glowing.</p>

<p>"If you would only take me away," she sighed.</p>

<p>"But where?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere&mdash;to any country. You will be my
country."</p>

<p>"Elope? A noble young girl&mdash;elope like an
adventuress?"</p>

<p>"Love will secure my pardon."</p>

<p>"I will pardon you; no others will."</p>

<p>"You will be my family, my all. Take me
away."</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, where should we find refuge?
Without means, without friends, having committed
a great fault, our life would be most
unhappy."</p>

<p>"No, no, no! Take me away. We'll have a
little time of poverty, after which I shall get possession
of my fortune. Take me away."</p>

<p>"And I shall be accused of having made a good
speculation. No, no, Anna, it's impossible. I
couldn't bear such a shame."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>She started away from him, pushing him back
with a movement of horror.</p>

<p>"What?" she cried. "What? You would be
ashamed? It's your shame that preoccupies you?
And mine? Honoured, esteemed, loved, I care
nothing for this honour, this love, and am willing
to lose all, the respect of people, the affection of
my relations&mdash;and you think of yourself! I could
have chosen any one of a multitude of young men
of my own rank, my own set, and I have chosen
you because you were good and honest and clever.
And you are ashamed of what bad people and
stupid people may say of you! I&mdash;I brave everything.
I lie, I deceive. I leave my bed at the
dead of night, steal out during my sister's sleep&mdash;out
of my room, out of my house, like a guilty
servant, so that they might call me the lowest of
the low. I do all this to come to you; and you
are thinking of speculations, of what the world will
say about you. Oh, how strong you are, you men!
How well you know your way; how straight you
march, never listening to the voices that call to
you, never feeling the hands that try to stop you&mdash;nothing,
nothing, nothing! You are men, and have
your honour to look after, your dignity to preserve,
your delicate reputation to safeguard. You are
right, you are reasonable. And so we are fools;
we are mad, who step out of the path of honour
and dignity for the love of you&mdash;we poor silly
creatures of our hearts!"</p>

<p>Giustino had not attempted to protest against
this outburst of violent language; but every word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of it, hot with wrath, vibrant with sorrowful
anger, stirred him to the quick, held him silenced,
frightened, shaken by her voice, by the tumult of
her passion. Now the fire which he had rashly
kindled burnt up the whole beautiful, simple,
stable edifice of his planning, and all he could
see left of it was a smoking ruin. He loved her&mdash;she
loved him; and though he knew it was wild
and unreasonable. "Forgive me," he said; "let
us go away."</p>

<p>She put her hand upon his head, and he heard
her murmur, under her voice, "O God!"</p>

<p>They both felt that their life was decided, that
they had played the grand stake of their existence.</p>

<p>There was a long pause; she was the first to
break it.</p>

<p>"Listen, Giustino. Before we fly let me make
one last attempt. You have spoken to Cesare
Dias; you have told him that you love me, that I
adore you; but he didn't believe you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is true. He smiled incredulously."</p>

<p>"He is a man who has seen a great deal of the
world, who has been loved, who has loved; but of all
that nothing is left to him. He is cold and solitary.
He never speaks of his scepticism, but he believes
in nothing. He's a miserable, arid creature. I know
that he despises me, thinking me silly and enthusiastic.
I pity him as I pity every one who has
no love in his heart. And yet&mdash;I will speak to
Cesare Dias. The truth will well up from me
with such impetus that he cannot refuse to believe
me. I'll tell him everything. In spite of his forty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
years, in spite of the corruption of his mind, in
spite of all his scorn, all his irony, true love will
find convincing words. He'll give his consent."</p>

<p>"Can't you first persuade your sister? There
we'd have an affectionate ally," said Giustino,
tentatively.</p>

<p>"My sister is worse than Cesare Dias," she
answered, with a slight tremor of the voice; "I
should never dare to depend on her."</p>

<p>"You are afraid of her?"</p>

<p>"Pray don't speak of her, don't speak of her.
It's a subject which pains me."</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no. Laura knows nothing; she must
know nothing; it would be dreadful if she knew.
I'd a thousand times rather speak to him. He
will remember his past; Laura has no past&mdash;she
has nothing&mdash;she's a dead soul. I will speak with
him; he will believe me."</p>

<p>"And if he shouldn't believe you?"</p>

<p>"He <em>will</em> believe me."</p>

<p>"But, Anna, Anna, if he shouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;we will elope. But I ought to make
this last attempt. Heaven will give me strength.
Afterwards&mdash;I will write to you, I will tell you
everything. I daren't come here any more. It's
too dangerous. If any one should see me it
would be the ruin of all our hopes. I'll write to
you. You'll arrange your own affairs in the
meantime&mdash;as if you were at the point of death,
as if you were going to leave this country never to
return. You must be ready at any instant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll be ready."</p>

<p>"Surely?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"Without a regret?"</p>

<p>"Without a regret." But his voice died on
his lips.</p>

<p>"Thank you; you love me. We shall be so
happy! You will see. Happier than any one in
the world!"</p>

<p>"So happy!" murmured Giustino, faithful but
sad.</p>

<p>"And may Heaven help us," she concluded,
fervently, putting out her hand to leave him.</p>

<p>He took her hand, and his pressure of it was a
silent vow; but it was the vow of a friend, of a
brother, simple and austere.</p>

<p>She moved slowly away, as if tired. He
remained where he was, waiting a little before
returning to his own terrace. Not until some ten
minutes had passed, during which he heard no
sound, no movement, could he feel satisfied that
Anna had safely reached her room.</p>

<p>Once at home, he found himself used up, exhausted,
without ideas, without emotions. And
speedily he fell asleep.</p>

<p>She also was exhausted by the great moral
crisis through which she had passed. An immense
burden seemed to bow her down, to make heavy
her footsteps, as she groped her way through the
silent house.</p>

<p>When she reached the sitting-room she stopped
with sudden terror. A light was burning in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
bedroom. Laura would be awake, would have
remarked her absence, would be waiting for her.</p>

<p>She stood still a long while. She could hear a
sound as of the pages of a book being turned.
Laura was reading.</p>

<p>At last she pushed open the door, and crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>Laura looked at her, smiled haughtily, and did
not speak.</p>

<p>Anna fell on her knees before her, crying,
"Forgive me. For pity's sake, Laura, forgive me.
Laura, Laura, Laura!"</p>

<p>But the child remained silent, white and cold
and virginal, never ceasing to smile scornfully.</p>

<p>Anna lay on the floor, weeping. And the
winter dawn found her there, weeping, weeping;
while her sister slept peacefully.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>The letter ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Love</span>,&mdash;I have had my interview
with Cesare Dias. What a man! His mere
presence seemed to freeze me; it was enough if
he looked at me, with his big clear blue eyes, for
speech to fail me. There is something in his
silence which frightens me; and when he speaks,
his sharp voice quells me by its tone as well as
by the hard things he says.</p>

<p>"And yet this morning when he came for his
usual visit, I was bold enough to speak to him of
my marriage. I spoke simply, briefly, without
trembling, though I could see that the courtesy
with which he listened was ironical. Laura was
present, taciturn and absent-minded as usual.
She shrugged her shoulders indifferently, disdainfully,
and then, getting up, left the room with that
light footstep of hers which scarcely seems to
touch the earth.</p>

<p>"Cesare Dias smiled without looking at me,
and his smile disconcerted me horribly, putting all
my thoughts into confusion. But I felt that I ought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

to make the attempt&mdash;I ought. I had promised
it to you, my darling, and to myself. My life
had become insupportable; the more so because
of my sister, who knew my secret, who tortured
me with her contempt&mdash;the contempt of a person
who has never loved for one who does&mdash;who
might at any moment betray me, and tell the story
of that wintry night.</p>

<p>"Cesare Dias smiled, and didn't seem to care
in the least to hear what I had to say. However,
in spite of my emotion, in spite of the fact
that I was talking to a man who cared nothing
for me and for whom I cared nothing, in spite
of the gulf that divides a character like mine
from that of Cesare Dias, I had the courage to
tell him that I adored you, that I wished to live
and die with you, that my fortune would suffice
for our needs, that I would never marry any one
but you; and finally, that, humbly, earnestly, I
besought him, as my guardian, my nearest relation,
my wisest friend, to give his consent to our
marriage.</p>

<p>"He had listened, with his eyes cast down,
giving no sign of interest. And now at the end
he simply uttered a dry little 'No.'</p>

<p>"And then took place a dreadful scene. I
implored, I wept, I rebelled, I declared that my
heart was free, that my person was free; and
always I found that I was addressing a man of
stone, hard and dry, with a will of iron, an utterly
false point of view, a conventional standard based
upon the opinion of the world, and a total lack of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>

good feeling. Cesare Dias denied that I loved
you, denied that you loved me, denied that any
such thing as real love could exist&mdash;real love for
which people live and die! He denied that love
was a thing not to be forgotten; denied that love
is the only thing that makes life worth while.
His one word was No&mdash;no, no, no, from the
beginning to the end of our talk. He made the
most specious, extravagant, and cynical arguments
to convince me that I was deceiving myself, that
we were deceiving ourselves, and that it was his
duty to oppose himself to our folly. Oh, how I
wept! How I abased my spirit before that man,
who reasoned in this cold strain! and how it hurts
me now to think of the way I humiliated myself!
I remember that while my love for you, dearest,
was breaking out in wild utterance, I saw that he
was looking admiringly at me, as in a theatre he
might admire an actor who was cleverly feigning
passion. He did not believe me; and two or
three times my anger rose to such a point that I
stooped to threaten him; I threatened to make a
public scandal.</p>

<p>"'The scandal will fall on the person who
makes it,' he said severely, getting up, to cut short
the conversation.</p>

<p>"He went away. In the drawing-room I heard
him talking quietly with Laura, as if nothing had
happened, as if he hadn't left me broken-hearted,
as if he didn't know that I was on my knees, in
despair, calling upon the names of the Madonna
and the Saints for help. But that man has no

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

soul; and I am surrounded by people who think
me a mad enthusiast.</p>

<p>"My love, my darling love, my constant thought&mdash;it
is then decided: we must fly. We must fly.
Here, like this, I should die. Anything will be
better than this house; it is a prison. Anything
is better than the galleys.</p>

<p>"I know that what I propose is very grave.
According to the common judgment of mankind
a young girl who elopes is everlastingly dishonoured.
In spite of the sanctity of marriage,
suspicion never leaves her. I know that I am
throwing away a great deal for a dream of love.
But that is my strange and cruel destiny&mdash;the
destiny which has given me a fortune and taken
away my father; given me a heart eager for
affection and cut me off from all affection; given
me the dearest and at the same time the least
loving sister!</p>

<p>"For whom ought I to sacrifice myself, since
those who loved me are dead, and those who live
with me do not love me? I need love; I have
found it; I will attach myself to it; I will not let
it go. Who will weep for me here? No one.
Whose hands will be stretched out to call me
back? No one's. What memories will I carry
away with me? None. I am lonely and misunderstood;
I am flying from ice and snow to the
warm sunlight of love. You are the sun, you are
my love. Don't think ill of me. I am not like
other girls, girls who have a home, a family, a nest.
I am a poor pilgrim, seeking a home, a family, a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>

nest. I will be your wife, your sweetheart, your
servant; I love you. A life passed in the holy
atmosphere of your love will be an absolution for
this fault that I am committing. I know, the
world will not forgive me. But I despise people
who can't understand one's sacrificing everything
for love. And those who do not understand it
will pity me. I shall care for nothing but your
love; you will forgive me because you love me.</p>

<p>"So, it is decided. On the third day after you
receive this letter&mdash;that is, on Friday&mdash;leave your
house as if you were going for a walk, without
luggage, and take a cab to the railway station.
Take the train that leaves Naples for Salerno at
one o'clock, and arrives at Pompeii at two. I
shan't be at the station at Pompeii&mdash;that might
arouse suspicions; but I shall be in the streets of
the dead city, looking at the ruins. Find me
there&mdash;come as swiftly as you can&mdash;to the
Street of Tombs, leading to the Villa of Diomedes,
near to the grave of Nevoleia Tyche, 'a sweet
Pompeiian child,' according to her epitaph. We
will meet there, and then we will leave for Metaponto
or Brindisi, and sail for the East. I have
money. You know, Cesare Dias, to save himself
trouble, has allowed me to receive my entire
income for the past two years. Afterwards&mdash;when
this money is spent&mdash;well, we will work for
our living until I come of age.</p>

<p>"You understand? You needn't worry about
me. I shall get out of the house, go to the station,
and arrive at Pompeii without being surprised. I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>


have a bold and simple plan, which I can't
explain to you. It would not do for us to meet
here in town, the risk would be too great. But
leaving for Pompeii by separate trains, how can
any one suspect us? Does my clearness of
mind astonish you? My calmness, my precision?
For twenty days I have been thinking of this
matter; I have lain awake at night studying it
in detail.</p>

<p>"Remember, remember: Friday, at noon, leave
your house. At one, leave the station. At half-past
two come to me at the grave of Nevoleia
Tyche. Don't forget, for mercy's sake. If you
shouldn't arrive at the right time, what would
become of me, alone, at Pompeii, in anguish,
devoured by anxiety?</p>

<p>"My sweetest love, this is the last letter you
will receive from me. Why, as I write these
words, does a feeling of sorrow come upon me,
making me bow my head? The word <em>last</em> is
always sad, whenever it is spoken. Will you
always love me, even though far from your country,
even though poor, even though unhappy?
You won't accuse me of having wronged you?
You will protect me and sustain me with your
love? You will be kind, honest, loyal. You will
be all that I care for in the world.</p>

<p>"This is my last letter, it is true, but soon
now our wondrous future will begin&mdash;our life
together. Remember, remember where I shall
wait for you.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 2em;">Anna."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Alone in his little house, Giustino Morelli read
Anna's letter twice through, slowly, slowly. Then
his head fell upon his breast. He felt that he was
lost, ruined; that Anna was lost and ruined.</p>

<p>At that early morning hour the Church of
Santa Chiara, white with stucco, rich with gold
ornamentation, with softly carved marbles and old
pictures, was almost empty. A few pious old
women moved vaguely here and there, wrapped
in black shawls; a few knelt praying before the
altar. Anna Acquaviva and her governess, Stella
Martini, were seated in the middle of the church,
with their eyes bent on their prayer-books. Stella
Martini had a worn, sunken face, that must have
once been delicately pretty, with that sort of
prettiness which fades before thirty. Anna wore
a dark serge frock, with a jacket in the English
fashion; and her black hair was held in place by
a comb of yellow tortoise-shell. The warm
pallor of her face was broken by no trace of
colour. Every now and then she bit her lips
nervously. She had held her prayer-book open
for a long while without turning a page. But
Stella Martini had not noticed this; she was
praying fervently.</p>

<p>Presently the young girl rose.</p>

<p>"I am going to confession," she said, standing
still, holding on to the back of her chair.</p>

<p>The governess did not seek to detain her.
With a light step she crossed the church and
entered a confessional.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>There the good priest, with the round, childlike
face and the crown of snow-white hair, asked his
usual questions quietly, not surprised by the
tremor in the voice that answered him. He knew
the character of his penitent.</p>

<p>But Anna answered incoherently; often not
understanding the sense of the simple words the
priest addressed to her. Sometimes she did not
answer at all, but only sighed behind the grating.</p>

<p>At last her confessor asked with some anxiety:
"What is it that troubles you?"</p>

<p>"Father, I am in great danger," she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>But when he sought to learn what her danger
was she would give him no details. He begged
her to speak frankly, to tell him everything; she
only murmured:</p>

<p>"Father, I am threatened with disgrace."</p>

<p>Then he became severe, reminding her that it
was a great sin to come thus and trifle with a
sacrament of the church, to come to the confessional
and refuse to confess. He could not
give her absolution.</p>

<p>"I will come another time," she said rising.</p>

<p>But now, instead of returning to her governess,
who was still praying with her eyes cast down, Anna
stole swiftly out of the church into the street, where
she hailed a cab, and bade the cabman drive to the
railway station. She drew down the blinds of the
carriage windows, and there in the darkness she
could scarcely suppress a cry of mingled joy and
pain to find herself at last alone and free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The cab rolled on and on; it was like the
movement of a dream. The only thing she could
think of was this beautiful and terrible idea, that
she, Anna Acquaviva, had abandoned for ever her
home and her family, carrying away only so much
of her fortune as the purse in her pocket could
hold, to throw herself into the arms of Giustino
Morelli. No feeling of fear held her back. Her
entire past life was ended, she could never take it
up again; it was over, it was over.</p>

<p>In that sort of somnambulism which accompanies
a decisive action, she was as exact and
rigid in everything she had to do as an automaton.
At the station she paid her cabman, and
mechanically asked for a ticket to Pompeii at the
booking-office.</p>

<p>"Single or return?" inquired the clerk.</p>

<p>"Single," she answered.</p>

<p>As almost every one who went to Pompeii took
a return ticket, the clerk thought he had to do
with an Englishwoman or an impassioned antiquary.</p>

<p>She put the ticket into the opening of her
glove, and went into the first-class waiting-room.
She looked about her quite indifferently, as if it
was impossible that Cesare Dias or indeed any
one of her acquaintance should see her there.
She was conscious of nothing save a great need to
go on, to go on; nothing else. It was the first
time in her life that she had been out alone like
this, yet she felt no surprise. It seemed to her
that she had been travelling alone for years; that
Cesare Dias, Laura Acquaviva, and Stella Martini
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
were pale shadows of an infinitely distant past, a
past anterior to her present existence; that they
were people she had known in another world.
She kept repeating to herself, like a child trying
to remember a word,</p>

<p>"Pompeii, Pompeii, Pompeii."</p>

<p>But when she was climbing into the first-class
compartment of the train, it seemed suddenly as
if a force held her back, as if a mysterious hand
forbade her going on. She trembled, and had to
make a violent effort to enter the carriage, as if to
brush aside an invisible obstacle. And, from that
moment, a voice within her seemed to be murmuring
confusedly to her conscience, warning her of
the great moral crisis she was approaching; while
before her eyes the blue Neapolitan coast was
passing rapidly, where the wintry cold had given
way to a warm scirocco. On, on, the morning
train hurried her, over the land, by the sea, between
the white houses of Portici, the pink houses
of Torre del Greco, the houses, pink, white, and
yellow, of Torre Annunziata&mdash;on, on. And Anna,
motionless in her corner, gazing out of the window,
beheld a vague, delicious vision of flowers and
stars and kisses and caresses; and an icy terror,
a sense of imminent peril, lay upon her heart.
Oh, yes! In a brilliant vision she saw a future
of love, of passion and tenderness, a fire-hued
vision of all that soul and body could desire; yet
constantly that still, small voice kept whispering
to her conscience: "Don't go, don't go. If you
go, you are lost."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>And this presently became so unbearable that,
when the train entered the brown, burnt-up
country at the foot of Vesuvius, the country that
surrounds the great ruin of Pompeii, despair was
making her twist the handle of her purse violently
with her fingers. The green vines and the laughing
villages had disappeared from the landscape;
the blue sea, with its dancing white waves, had
disappeared; she was crossing a wide, desolate
plain; and the volcano, with its eternal wreath
of smoke, rose before her. And also had disappeared
for ever the phantasms of her happiness!
Anna was travelling alone, through a sterile land,
where fire had passed, devastating all life, killing
the flowers, destroying the people, their homes,
their pleasures, their loves. And the voice within
her cried: "This is a symbol of Passion, which
destroys all things, and then dies itself."</p>

<p>And then she thought that she had chosen
ominously in coming to Pompeii&mdash;a city of love,
destroyed by fire, an everlasting reminder to those
who saw it of the tragedy of life&mdash;Pompeii, with
its hard heart of lava!</p>

<p>She descended from the carriage when the
train stopped, and followed a family of Germans
and two English clergymen out of the tiny
station.</p>

<p>She went on, looking neither to right nor left,
up the narrow, dusty lane that leads from the
railway to the inn at the city's gate. Neither the
Germans nor the clergymen noticed her; the
solitary young woman, with the warm, pale face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and the great brown-black eyes that gazed
straight forward, without interest in what they
saw, the eyes of a soul consumed by an emotion.
When they had all entered the house, she ensconced
herself in a corner near a window, and
looked out upon the path she had followed, as if
waiting for somebody, or as if wishing to turn
back.</p>

<p>And Anna was praying for the safe coming of
Giustino. If she could but see him, if she could
but hear his voice, all her doubts, all her pains,
would fly away.</p>

<p>"I adore him! I adore him!" she thought, and
tried thus to find strength with which to combat
her conscience. Her heart was filled with a single
wish&mdash;to see Giustino; he would give her strength;
he was the reason for her life&mdash;he and love. She
looked at her little child's watch, the only jewel
she had brought away; she had a long time still
to wait before two o'clock.</p>

<p>An old guide approached her, and offered to
show her the ruins. She followed him mechanically.
They traversed the Street of Hope, the
Street of Fortune, where there are the deep marks
of carriage wheels in the stone pavement; they
entered houses and shops and squares; she
looked at everything with vacant eyes. Twice
the guide said: "Now let us visit the Street of
Tombs and the Villa of Diomedes." Twice she
had answered: "Later on; by-and-by."</p>

<p>Two or three times she had sat down on a
stone to rest; and then her poor old guide had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sat down also, at a distance, and let his head fall
forward on his breast, and dozed. She was
strangely fatigued; she had exhausted her forces
in making the journey hither; the tumult of
emotion she had gone through had prostrated
her. Now she felt utterly alone and abandoned&mdash;a
poor, unfortunate creature bearing through
this dead city a heavy burden of solitude and
weariness: and when, after a long rest, she got
up to go on again, a great sigh broke from her
lips.</p>

<p>But somehow she must pass the time, and so
she went on. She climbed to the top of the
Amphitheatre, seeking to devour the minutes that
separated her from two o'clock.</p>

<p>Presently the old man said, for the third time:
"Now let us visit the Street of Tombs and the
Villa of Diomedes."</p>

<p>"Let us go," she responded.</p>

<p>The hours had passed at last; only one more
remained. With her watch in her hand, as the
guide pointed out to her the magnificence of the
Villa of Diomedes, she was saying to herself,
"Now Giustino is leaving Naples."</p>

<p>Impatient, no longer able to endure the voice
or presence of the old man, no longer able to
hide her own perturbation, she paid and dismissed
him. He hesitated, reluctant to leave her, telling
her that it was forbidden to make sketches, and,
above all, to carry anything away; but he said it
timidly, humbly, knowing very well that it was
needless to fear any such infractions from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
pale girl with the dreamy eyes. And he moved
off, slowly, slowly, turning back every now and
then to see what she was doing. She sat down
on a stone in front of the tomb of the "sweet
freed-woman," Nevoleia Tyche, and waited there,
her hands in her lap, her head bent; nor did she
look up when a party of English passed her,
accompanied by a guide. This last hour seemed
interminable to her; it seemed covered by a great
shadow, in which all things were obscured. The
name of Giustino, constantly repeated, was like a
single ray of light. She neither heard nor saw
what was going on round about her; her consciousness
of the external world was put out.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadow fell between her and the
grey tomb of the freed-woman. She looked
up, and saw Giustino standing before her, gazing
down on her with an infinite despairing
tenderness.</p>

<p>Anna, unable to speak, gave him her hand,
and rose. And a smile of happiness, like a great
light, shone from her eyes, and a warm colour
mantled her cheeks. Giustino had never seen
her so beautiful. In an ecstasy of joy, feeling all
her doubts die within her, feeling all the glory of
her love spring to full life again, Anna could not
understand why there was an expression of sorrow
on Giustino's face.</p>

<p>"Do you love me&mdash;a great deal?"</p>

<p>"A great deal."</p>

<p>"You will always care for me?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>It was like a sad, soft echo, but the girl did not
notice that; a veil of passion dimmed her perceptions.
They walked on together, she close to him,
so happy that her feet scarcely touched the earth,
enjoying this minute of intense love with all the
force of feeling that she possessed, with all the
self-surrender of which human nature is capable.
They walked on through the streets of Pompeii,
without seeing, without looking. Only again and
again she said softly: "Tell me that you love me&mdash;tell
me that you love me!"</p>

<p>Two or three times he had answered simply,
"Yes," then he was silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Anna, not hearing his answer, stood
still, and taking his arms in her hands, looked deep
into his honest eyes, and asked, "What is the
matter?"</p>

<p>Her voice trembled. He lowered his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said.</p>

<p>"Why are you so sad?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sad," he answered with an effort.</p>

<p>"You're telling the truth?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling the truth."</p>

<p>"Swear that you love me."</p>

<p>"Do you need me to swear it?" he exclaimed
with such sincerity and such pain that she was convinced,
perceiving the sincerity, but not the pain.</p>

<p>But she was still troubled; there was still a
bitterness in her joy. They were near the Street
of the Sea, which leads out of the dead city.</p>

<p>"Let us go away, let us go away," she said
impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"The train for Metaponto doesn't leave till six
o'clock; we've plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Let us go away! I don't want to stay here
any longer. I beg of you, let us go."</p>

<p>He obeyed her passively and was silent. They
entered the inn on their way to the station, at the
same time as the two English clergymen. Anna
was frightened; she didn't care to talk of love to
Giustino before such witnesses, but she looked at
him with fond, supplicating eyes. The two clergymen
seated themselves at the table which is always
laid in the chief room of the inn, and while they
ate their dinner one of them read his Bible, the
other his Baedeker. The two lovers were near the
window, looking through the glass at the road that
leads to the station; and Anna was holding on to
Giustino's arm, and he, confused, nervous, asked
her if she would not like to dine, taking refuge
from his embarrassment in the commonplace.
"No; she did not wish to dine, she wasn't hungry.
Afterwards, by-and-by." And her voice failed her
as she looked at the two ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;&mdash;" she began, whispering into Giustino's
ear.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?"</p>

<p>"Take me away somewhere else, where I can
say something to you."</p>

<p>He hesitated; she blushed; then he left the
room to speak to the landlord; returning presently,
"Come," he said.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upstairs?"</p>

<p>"You will see."</p>

<p>They went upstairs to the first floor, where the
waiter who conducted them opened the door of an
apartment consisting of a bedroom and sitting-room&mdash;a
big bedroom, a tiny sitting-room&mdash;both
having balconies that looked off over the country,
and there the waiter left them alone.</p>

<p>Each of them was pale, silent, confused.</p>

<p>She looked round. The sitting-room was vulgarly
furnished with a green sofa, two green easy-chairs,
a centre-table covered with a nut-coloured
jute tablecloth, and a marble console. The thought
of the many strangers who had inhabited it inspired
her with a sort of shame. Then she glanced into
the bedroom. It was very large, with two beds at
the farther end, a dressing-table, a sofa, and a wardrobe.
These pieces of furniture seemed lost in the
vast bare-looking chamber. It gave her a shudder
merely to look into it; and yet again she blushed.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to Giustino's, and she noticed
anew that he was gazing at her with an expression
of great sadness.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>He did not answer. He sat down and buried
his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is," she insisted, trembling
with anger and anguish.</p>

<p>He remained silent. Perhaps he was weeping
behind his hands.</p>

<p>"If you don't tell me what it is, I'll go back to
Naples," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not speak.</p>

<p>"You despise me because I have left my home."</p>

<p>"No, Anna," he murmured.</p>

<p>"You think I'm dreadful&mdash;you think of me as
an abandoned creature."</p>

<p>"No, dear one&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;you&mdash;love another woman."</p>

<p>"You can't think that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;you have&mdash;another tie&mdash;without
love."</p>

<p>"None; I am bound to no one."</p>

<p>"You have promised yourself to no one?"</p>

<p>"To no one."</p>

<p>"Then why are you so sad? Why do you weep?
Why do you tremble? It is I who ought to weep
and tremble, and yet I don't weep unless to see
you weep. Your weeping breaks my heart, makes
me desperate."</p>

<p>"Anna, listen to me. By the memory of your
mother I implore you to listen, to understand. I
am miserable because of you, on your account&mdash;in
thinking of what I have allowed you to do, of
how you are throwing away your future, of the
unhappiness that awaits you; without a home,
without a name, persecuted by your family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you loved me, you wouldn't think these
things; you wouldn't say them."</p>

<p>"I have always said them, Anna; I have always
repeated them. I have ruined you. For three days
I have been in an agony of remorse; it is the
same to-day. Though you are the light of my
life, I must say it to you. To-day I can't forgive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
myself; to-morrow you will be unable to forgive
me. Oh, my love! I am a gentleman, I am a
Christian; and yet I have been weak enough to
allow you and me to commit this sin, this fault."</p>

<p>Speaking thus, with an infinite earnestness, all
the honesty of his noble soul showed itself, a soul
bowed down by remorse. She looked at him
and listened to him with stupefaction, amazed at
this spectacle of a rectitude, of a virtue that was
greater than love, for she believed only in love.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," she said.</p>

<p>"And yet you must&mdash;you must. If you don't
see the reasons for my conduct you will despise
me, you will hate me. You must try, with all
your heart, with all your mind, to understand.
You mustn't let yourself be carried away by your
love. You must be calm, you must be cool."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"O God!" he said in despair.</p>

<p>Again he was silent. She mechanically, to
overcome the trembling of her hands, pulled at
the fringe of the tablecloth. She tried to reflect,
to understand. And always, always, she had the
same feeling, the same idea, and she could not
help trying to express it in words: "You don't
love me enough." She looked into his eyes as
she spoke, concentrating her whole soul in her
voice and in her gaze.</p>

<p>"It is true, I don't love you enough," he
answered.</p>

<p>She made no sound: she was cut to the heart.
The little sitting-room, the inn, Pompeii, the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
world appeared to go whirling round her dizzily.
She had a feeling as if her temples would burst
open, and pressed her hands to them instinctively.</p>

<p>"Ah, then," she said, after a long pause, in a
broken voice&mdash;"ah, then, you have deceived me?"</p>

<p>"I have deceived you," he murmured humbly.</p>

<p>"You haven't loved me?"</p>

<p>"Not enough to forget everything else. I have
already said so."</p>

<p>"I understand. What was the use of lying?"</p>

<p>"Because you were beautiful and good, and you
loved me, and I didn't see this danger. I didn't
dream that you would wish to give up everything
in this way, that I should be unable to prevent
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Words, words. The essential is, you don't
love me."</p>

<p>"As you wish to be loved, as you deserve to be
loved&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"That is, without blind passion?"</p>

<p>"Without blind passion."</p>

<p>"That is, without fire, without enthusiasm?"</p>

<p>"Without fire, without enthusiasm."</p>

<p>"Then, with what?"</p>

<p>"With tenderness, with affection, with devotion."</p>

<p>"It is not enough, not enough, not enough,"
she said monotonously, as if talking in her sleep.
"Don't you know how to love differently. More&mdash;as
I love&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know how."</p>

<p>"Do you think you never can? Perhaps you
can to-morrow, or in the future?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I never can, Anna. I shall always prefer
duty to happiness."</p>

<p>"Poor, weak creature," she murmured with
immense scorn.</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes towards heaven, as if seeking
strength to endure his martyrdom.</p>

<p>"So," Anna went on, slowly, "if we were to
live together, you would be unhappy?"</p>

<p>"We should both be unhappy, and the sight of
your unhappiness, of which I should be the cause,
would kill me."</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"It's for you to say what you wish."</p>

<p>The cruel, the terrible reality was clear to her;
there was only one thing to be said, and that was
so unexpectedly dreadful that she hesitated to say
it. The truth was so horrible, she could not bear
to give it shape in speech. She looked at him&mdash;at
this man who, to save her, inflicted such inexpressible
pain upon her. And he understood that
Anna could not pronounce the last words. He
himself, in spite of his great courage, could not
speak them, those last words, for he loved the girl
wildly. The terrible truth appalled them both.</p>

<p>She got up stiffly and went to the window and
leaned her forehead against the glass, looking out
over the country and down the lane that led to
the little station. Twice before that day she had
looked at the same silent landscape; but in the
morning, when she was alone, waiting, thrilling
with hope, and again, only an hour ago, leaning
on Giustino's arm, she had possessed entire the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
priceless treasure of a great love. Now, now all
was over; nevermore, nevermore would she know
the delight of love: all was over, all, all.</p>

<p>Giustino had not moved from where he sat with
his face buried in his hands. Suddenly Anna
seized him by the shoulders, forced him to raise
his head, and began to speak, so close to him that
he could feel her warm breath on his cheek.</p>

<p>"And yet you did love me," she said, passionately.
"You can't deny it; I know it. I have
seen you turn pale when you met me, as pale as I
myself. If I spoke to you my voice made your
eyes brighten, as your voice made my heart leap.
You looked for me everywhere, as I looked for
you, feeling that the world would be colourless
without love. And your letters bore the imprint
of a great tenderness. But that is love, true love,
passionate love, which isn't forgotten in a day
or in a year, for which a whole life-time is not
sufficient. It isn't possible that you don't love me
any more. You do love me; you are deceiving
me when you say you don't. I don't know why.
But speak the truth&mdash;tell me that it is impossible
for you to have got over such a passion."</p>

<p>He felt all his courage leaving him under this
tumult of words.</p>

<p>"Giustino, Giustino, think of what you are
doing in denying our love. Think of the two
lives you are ruining; for you yourself will be as
miserable as I. Giustino, you will kill me; if you
leave me here, I shall kill myself. Let us go
away; let us go away together. Take me away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
You love me. Let us start at once; now is the
time."</p>

<p>It seemed for a moment as if he were on the
point of giving way. He was a man with a
man's nerves, a man's senses, a man's heart; and
he loved her ardently. But when again she begged
him to fly with her, and he felt himself almost
yielding, he made a great effort to resist her.</p>

<p>"I can't, Anna; I cannot," he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Then you wish me to die?"</p>

<p>"You won't die. You are young. You will
live to be happy again."</p>

<p>"All is over for me, Giustino. This is death."</p>

<p>"No, it's not death, Anna."</p>

<p>"You talk like Cesare Dias," she cried, moving
away from him. "You speak like a sceptic who
has neither love nor faith. You are like him&mdash;corrupt,
cynical&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You insult me; but you're right."</p>

<p>"I am dishonoured: do you realise that? I
am a fugitive from my people; I am alone here
with you in an hotel. I am dishonoured, dishonoured,
coward that you are. You can go
home quietly, having had an amusing adventure;
but I&mdash;I have no home any more. I was a good
girl; now I am lost."</p>

<p>"Your people know where you are and what
you have done&mdash;that you have done nothing
wrong. They know that you have done it in
response to a generous impulse for one who was
not worthy of you, but who has respected you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"And who told them?"</p>

<p>"I."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"This morning."</p>

<p>"To whom did you tell it?"</p>

<p>"To your sister and your guardian."</p>

<p>"Did they come to ask you?"</p>

<p>"No, I went to them."</p>

<p>"And what did you agree upon amongst you?"</p>

<p>"That I should come here and meet you."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"That I should leave you."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When Cesare Dias was ready to come and
fetch you."</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful plan," she said, icily. "The
plan of calm, practical men. Bravo, bravo!
You&mdash;you ran to my people, to exculpate yourself,
to accuse me, to reassure them. Good, good!
I am a mad child, guilty of a youthful escapade,
which fortunately hasn't touched my reputation.
You denounced me, told them that I wanted to
elope with you; and you are a gentleman!
Good! The whole thing was wonderfully well
combined. I am to return home with Cesare Dias
as if I had made a harmless little excursion, and
what's done is done. You're right, of course;
Cesare Dias is right; Laura Acquaviva, who has
never loved and who despises those who love,
Laura is right; you are all right. I alone am wrong.
Oh, the laughable adventure! To attempt an
elopement, and to fail in it, because the man won't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
elope. To return home because your lover has
denounced you to your family! What a
comedy! You are right. There has been no
catastrophe. The solution is immensely humorous:
I know it. I am like a suicide who didn't kill
herself. You are right. I am wrong. You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"
And she looked him full in the face,
withering him with her glance. "Begone! I
despise you. Begone!"</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, don't send me away like this."</p>

<p>"Begone! The cowardly way in which you
have behaved is past contempt. Begone!"</p>

<p>"We mustn't part like this."</p>

<p>"We are already parted, utterly separated. We
have always been separated. Go away."</p>

<p>"Anna, what I have done I have done for
your sake, for your good. Now you send me
away. Afterwards you will do me justice. I am
an honourable man&mdash;that is my sin."</p>

<p>"I don't know you. Good-day."</p>

<p>"But what will you do alone here?"</p>

<p>"That doesn't concern you. Good-day."</p>

<p>"Let me wait for Cesare Dias."</p>

<p>"If you don't go at once I'll open the window
and throw myself from the balcony," she said, with
so much firmness that he believed her.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, then."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>She stood in the middle of the room, a small
red spot burning in each of her cheeks, and
watched him go out, heard him descend the staircase,
slowly, with the heavy step of one bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a great burden. She leaned from the window
and saw the shadow of a man issue from the door
of the inn&mdash;it was Giustino. He stood still for a
moment, and then turned into the high road that
leads to Pompeii from Torre Annunziata, and
again stood still, as if to wait for somebody there.
Anna saw him turn towards the windows of the
hotel, and gaze up at them earnestly. At last he
moved slowly away and disappeared.</p>

<p>Anna came back into the room, and threw
herself upon the sofa, biting its cushions to keep
herself from screaming. Her head was on fire,
but she couldn't weep&mdash;not a tear, not a single
tear.</p>

<p>And in the midst of her trouble, constantly&mdash;whether,
as at one moment, she was pitying herself
as a poor child to whom a monstrous wrong
had been done, or as, at the next, burning with
scorn as a great lady offended in her pride; or
again, blushing with shame as she thought of the
imminent arrival of Cesare Dias&mdash;in the midst of
it all, through it all, constantly, one little agonising,
implacable phrase kept repeating itself: "All is
over, all is over, all is over!"</p>

<p>Presently a servant brought in a light.</p>

<p>"Please, madam, do you mean to stay the
night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The last train for Naples has already left.
You can go back by way of Torre Annunziata in
a carriage."</p>

<p>"Some one is coming for me," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The servant left the room.</p>

<p>By-and-by she heard her name called: "Anna!
Anna!"</p>

<p>She fell on her knees before Cesare Dias, sobbing:
"Forgive me, forgive me."</p>

<p>He, with a tremor in his voice, murmured, "My
poor child."</p>

<p>And at home, in her own house, she said to her
sister: "Laura, forgive me."</p>

<p>"My poor Anna."</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>For three weeks Anna lay at the point of death,
prey to a violent attack of scarlet fever, alternating
between delirium and stupor, and always moaning
in her pain; while Laura, Stella Martini, and a
Sister of Charity watched at her bedside.</p>

<p>But she did not die. The fever reached its
crisis, and then, little by little, day by day, abated.</p>

<p>At last her struggle with death was finished, but
Anna had lost in it the best part of her youth.
Thus a valorous warrior survives the battle indeed,
but returns to his friends the phantom of
himself&mdash;an object of pity to those who saw him
set forth, strong and gallant.</p>

<p>When the early Neapolitan spring began to
show itself, at the end of February, she was convalescent,
but so weak that she could scarcely
support the weight of her thick black hair. Stella
Martini tried very patiently to comb it so gently
that Anna should not have to move, braiding it in
two long plaits; in this way it would seem less
heavy. From time to time a big tear would roll
down the invalid's cheek.</p>

<p>She was weeping silently, slowly; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Laura or Stella Martini, or Sister Crocifissa would
ask her: "What is it; what can we do for you?"
Anna would answer with a sign which seemed to
say: "Let me weep; perhaps it will do me good
to weep."</p>

<p>"Let her weep, it will do her good to weep,"
was what the great doctor Antonio Amati had
said also. "Let her do whatever pleases her;
refuse her nothing if you can help it."</p>

<p>So her nurses, obedient to the doctor, did not
try to prevent her weeping, did not even try to
speak comforting words to her. Perhaps it was
not so much an active sorrow that made her shed
these tears, as a sort of sad relief.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias during this anxious time put aside
his occupations of a gay bachelor, and called two
or three times a day at the palace in Piazza Gerolomini
to inquire how Anna was. The two girls
had no nearer relative than he; and he, indeed,
was not a relative: he was their guardian, an old
friend of their father's, a companion of the youthful
sports of Francesco Acquaviva. The young
wife of Francesco had died five years after the
birth of her second daughter, Laura, who resembled
her closely: and thereupon her husband had proceeded
to shorten his own life by throwing himself
into every form of worldly dissipation. The two
children, growing up in the house, motherless in
the midst of profuse luxury, could exert no restraining
influence upon their father, who seemed
bent upon enjoying every minute of his existence
as if he realised that its end was near. His constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
companion was the cold, calm, sceptical
Cesare Dias, a man who appeared to despise the
very pleasures it was his one business to pursue.
And when Francesco Acquaviva fell ill, and was
about to die, he could think of nothing better than
to make the partner of his follies the guardian of
his children.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias had discharged his duties, not without
some secret annoyance, with a gentlemanlike
correctness; never treating his wards with much
familiarity, rarely showing himself in public with
them, keeping them at a distance, indeed, and feeling
very little interest in them. He was their
guardian&mdash;he, a man who, of all things, had least
desired to have a family, who spent the whole of
his income upon himself, who hated sentiment,
who had no ideal of friendship. Cesare Dias, a
man without tenderness, without affection, without
sympathy, was the guardian of two young girls.
He was this by the freak of Francesco Acquaviva.
Dias would be glad enough when the day came
for the girls to marry. When people congratulated
him upon his situation as a rich bachelor
with no obligations, he responded with a somewhat
sarcastic smile: "Pity me rather; I've got
two children&mdash;a legacy from Francesco Acquaviva."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll soon be married."</p>

<p>"I hope so," he murmured devoutly.</p>

<p>As he watched the girls grow up, the character
of Laura, haughty, and reserved, and silent, as if
she had already known a thousand disillusions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
began vaguely to please him, as if he saw obscurely
in a looking-glass a face that distantly
resembled his own: a faint admiration which was
really but reflex admiration of himself. The character
of Anna, on the contrary, open, loyal, impressionable
and impulsive, a character full of strong
likes and dislikes&mdash;imaginative, enthusiastic, generous&mdash;had
always roused in him a certain antipathy.</p>

<p>In her presence he seemed even colder and
more indifferent than elsewhere; merciless for all
human weakness, disdainful of all human interests.</p>

<p>It would have been a miracle if two such incompatible
natures, each so positive, had not
repelled each other. Sometimes, though, Anna
could not help feeling a certain secret respect for
this man, who perhaps had good reasons&mdash;reasons
born of suffering&mdash;for the contempt with which he
regarded his fellow-beings; and sometimes Dias
told himself that it was ridiculous to be angry
with this strange child, for she was a worthy
daughter of Francesco Acquaviva, a man who had
tossed his life to the winds of pleasure. Dias
asked himself scornfully, "What does it matter?"</p>

<p>And so, when he learned that his ward had
fallen in love with an obscure and penniless youth,
he shrugged his shoulders, murmuring, "Rhetoric!"
He deemed it wiser not to speak to her about the
matter, for he knew that the flame of love is only
fanned by the wind of contradiction; besides, it is
always useless to talk sensibly to a silly girl.</p>

<p>When Giustino Morelli had called upon him
and humbly asked for Anna's hand, Dias opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the ingenuous eloquence of love the cynical
philosophy of the world, and thought his trouble
ended when he saw the young man go away,
pale and resigned. "Rhetoric, rhetoric!" was his
mental commentary; and he had a theory that
what he called rhetoric could be trusted to die a
natural death. So he went back to his usual
occupation, giving the affair no further thought.</p>

<p>But chemical analysis cannot explain spontaneous
generation; criticism cannot explain
genius; and no more can cold reason explain or
understand youthful passion.</p>

<p>When it came to the knowledge of Cesare Dias
that Anna had left her home to give herself into
the keeping of a poor nobody, he was for a
moment stupefied; he seemed for a moment to
have a vision of that force whose existence he
had hitherto doubted, which can lift hearts up to
dizzy heights, and human beings far above convention.
He was a man of few words, a man of
action, but now he was staggered, nonplussed. A
child who could play her reputation and her
future like this, inspired him with a sort of vague
respect, a respect for the power that moved her.
Ah, there was a convulsion in the soul of Cesare
Dias, the man of fixed ideas and easy aphorisms,
who suddenly found himself face to face with
a moral crisis in which the life of his young
ward might be wrecked. And he felt a pang of
self-reproach. He ought to have watched more
carefully over her; he ought to have been kinder
to her; he ought not to have left her to walk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
unguided in the dangerous path of youth and
love.</p>

<p>He felt a certain pity for the poor weak
creature, who had gone, as it were, headlong over
a precipice without calling for help. He thought
that, if she had been his own daughter, he would
have endeavoured to cultivate her common sense,
to show her that it was impossible for people to
live constantly at concert pitch. He had, therefore,
failed in his duty towards her, in his office of
protector and friend; and yet what faith her dead
father, Francesco Acquaviva, had had in him, in
his wisdom, in his affection! Anna, who had
hitherto inspired him only with that disdain which
practical men feel for sentimentalists, now moved
him to compassion, as a defenceless being exposed
to all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
And during his drive from Naples to Pompeii he
promised himself that he would be very kind to
her, very gentle. If she had flown from her
home, it was doubtless because the love that
Giustino Morelli bore her had appeared greater to
her than the love of her own people; and doubtless,
too, there are hearts to whom love is as
necessary as bread is to the body. Never before
had Cesare Dias felt such an emotion as beset
him now during that long drive to Pompeii; for
years he had been on his guard against such
emotions.</p>

<p>And, accordingly, after that fatal day on which
he brought her back to her house, he and Laura
and Stella Martini all tried to create round Anna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a peaceful atmosphere of kindness and indulgence,
as if she had committed a grave but generous
error, by whose consequences she alone was hurt.
Laura&mdash;silent, thoughtful, with her dreamy grey
eyes, her placid face&mdash;nursed Anna through her
fever with quiet sisterly devotion. Cesare Dias
called every morning, entering the room on tiptoe,
inquiring with a glance how the sufferer was
doing, then seating himself at a distance from the
bed, without speaking. If Anna looked up, if he
felt her big sorrowful black eyes turned upon his
face, he would ask in a gentle voice, the voice of
<em>that day</em>, how she felt; she would answer with
a faint smile, "Better," and would shut her eyes
again, and go back to her interior contemplations.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias, after that, would get up noiselessly
and go away, to come again in the afternoon, and
still again in the evening, perhaps for a longer
visit.</p>

<p>Laura, always dressed in white, would meet him
in the sitting-room; and he would ask, "Is she
better?"</p>

<p>"She seems to be."</p>

<p>"Has she been asleep to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think she has been asleep."</p>

<p>"Has she said anything."</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Who is to watch with her to-night."</p>

<p>"I."</p>

<p>"You will wear yourself out."</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>Nothing else passed between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Often he would arrive in the evening wearing
his dress-suit; he had dined at his club, and was
off for a card-party or a first night at a theatre.
Then he would remain standing, with his overcoat
open, his hat in his hand. At such a time, a little
warmed up by the dinner he had eaten, or the
amusements that awaited him, Cesare Dias was
still a handsome man; his dull eyes shone with
some of their forgotten brightness; his cheeks had
a little colour in them; and his smooth black
hair gave him almost an appearance of youth.
One who had seen him in the morning, pale and
exhausted, would scarcely have recognised him.
Laura would meet him and part with him, never
asking whence he came or whither he was bound;
when he had said good-night she would return to
Anna, slowly, with her light footsteps that merely
brushed the carpet.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias told himself that if he wished to
make his sick ward over morally, now was the
time to begin, while her body was weak and her
soul malleable. It would be impossible to transform
her spirit after she had once got back her
strength. Anna was completely prostrated, passing
the entire day without moving, her arms
stretched out at full length, her hands pale and
cold, her face turned on the side, her two rich
plaits of black hair extended on her pillow;
bloodless her cheeks, her lips, her brow; lifeless
the glance of her eyes. When spoken to, she
answered with a slight movement of the head, or,
at most, one or two words&mdash;always the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Better."</p>

<p>"Do you wish for anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Is there nothing you would like?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>Whereupon she would close her eyes again,
exhausted. Nothing more would be said by those
round her, but Anna knew that they were there,
silent, talking together by means of significant
glances.</p>

<p>One day, Cesare Dias and Laura Acquaviva
felt that they could mark a progress in Anna's
convalescence, because two or three times she had
looked at them with an expression of such earnest
penitence, with such an eager prayer for pardon,
in her sad dark eyes, that words were not necessary
to tell what she felt. Soon afterwards she
seemed to wish to be left alone with Dias, as if
she had a secret to confide to him; but he cautiously
thought it best to defer any private talk.
However, one morning it so happened that he
found himself alone in her room. He was reading
a newspaper when a soft voice said:</p>

<p>"Listen."</p>

<p>Cesare Dias looked at her. Her black eyes
were again beseeching forgiveness, and Anna
stammered:</p>

<p>"What must you have thought&mdash;what must
you have said of me!"</p>

<p>"You must not excite yourself, my dear," he
said kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was so wicked," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that, dear Anna; you were
guilty of nothing more than a girlish folly."</p>

<p>"A sin, a sin."</p>

<p>"You must call things by their right names,
and not let your imagination get the better of you,"
he answered, somewhat coldly. "A youthful
folly."</p>

<p>"Well, be it as you wish," she said, humbly;
"but if you knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there," murmured Cesare Dias with the
shadow of a smile, "calm yourself; we'll speak of
this another day."</p>

<p>Laura had come back into the room, and her
presence cut short their talk.</p>

<p>That evening, by the faint light of a little lamp
that hung before an image of the Virgin at her
bedside, Anna saw the big grey eyes of Laura
gazing at her inquiringly; and therewith she
raised herself a little on her pillow and called her
sister to her.</p>

<p>"You are good; you don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't excite yourself."</p>

<p>"You are innocent, Laura, but you are my sister.
Don't judge me harshly."</p>

<p>"I don't judge you, Anna."</p>

<p>"Laura, Laura&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Anna."</p>

<p>Laura's tone was a little hard, but with her
hand she gently caressed her sister's cheek; and
Anna said nothing more.</p>

<p>As her recovery progressed, an expression of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
humility, of contrition, seemed to become more
and more constant upon her face when she had
to do with Laura or with Dias.</p>

<p>They were very kind to her, with that pitying
kindness which we show to invalids, to old people,
and to children&mdash;a kindness in marked contrast
to their former indifference, which awoke in her an
ever sharper and sharper remorse. She felt a
great difference between herself and them: they
were sane in body and mind, their blood flowed
tranquilly in their veins, their consciences were
untroubled; while she was broken in health, disturbed
in spirit, and miserable in thinking of her
past, its deceits, its errors, its thousand shameful
aberrations, its lack of maidenly decorum&mdash;and
for whom? for whom? For a fool, a simpleton,
a fellow who had neither heart nor courage, who
had never loved her, who was cruel and inept.
When she drew a mental comparison between
Giustino Morelli and these two persons whom she
had wished to desert for him&mdash;between Giustino, so
timid, so poor in all right feeling, so bankrupt in
passion, and them, so magnanimous, so forgetful
of her fault&mdash;her repentance grew apace. It was
the exaggerated repentance of a noble nature,
which magnifies the moral gravity of its own
transgressions. She felt herself to be quite undeserving
of the sympathy and affection with which
they treated her. Their kindness was an act of
gratuitous charity beyond her merits.</p>

<p>She would look from Laura to Cesare Dias and
murmur: "You are good; you are good." And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
then at the sound of her own voice she would be
so moved that she would weep; and pale, with
great dark circles under her eyes, she would
repeat, "So good, so good."</p>

<p>Her sole desire was to show herself absolutely
obedient to whatever her guardian demanded, to
whatever her sister advised.</p>

<p>She gave herself over, bound hand and foot, to
these two beings whom she had so cruelly forgotten
on the day of her mad adventure; in her
convalescence she found a great joy in throwing
herself absolutely upon their wisdom and their
goodness.</p>

<p>Little by little it seemed to her that she was
being born again to a new life, quiet, placid,
irresponsible; a life in which she would have no
will of her own, in which, passively, gladly, she
would be guided and controlled by them. So,
whenever they spoke to her, whenever they asked
for her opinion&mdash;whether a window should be
opened or closed, whether a bouquet of flowers
should be left in the room or carried out, whether
a note should be written to a friend who had
called to inquire how she was&mdash;she always said,
"Yes," or "As you think best," emphasising her
answer with a gesture and a glance.</p>

<p>"Yes" to whatever Cesare Dias suggested to
her; Cesare Dias who had grown in her imagination
to the proportions of a superior being, far
removed from human littleness, invincible, dwelling
in the highest spheres of abstract intellect; and
"Yes" to whatever Laura Acquaviva suggested,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Laura the pure, the impeccable, who had never
had the weakness to fall in love, who would die
rather than be wanting to her ideal of herself.
"Yes" even to whatever her poor governess,
Stella Martini, suggested; Stella so kind, so faithful,
whom in the past she had so heartlessly
deceived. "Yes" to the good Sister of Charity,
Maria del Crocifisso, who passed her life in self-sacrifice,
in self-abnegation, in loving devotion
to others. "Yes" to everybody. Anna said
nothing but "Yes," because she had been wrong,
and they had all been right.</p>

<p>She was getting well. Nothing remained of
her illness except a mortal weakness, a heaviness
of the head, an inability to concentrate her mind
upon one idea, a desire to rest where she was, not
to move from her bed, from her room, not to lift
her hands, to keep her eyes closed, her cheek buried
in her pillow. Cesare Dias called daily after luncheon,
at two o'clock, an hour when men of the
world have absolutely nothing to do, for visits are
not in order till four. The girls waited for him
every afternoon; Laura with her appearance of
being above all earthly trifles, showing neither
curiosity nor eagerness; Anna with a secret anxiety
because he would bring her a sense of calmness
and strength, a breath of the world's air, and especially
because he seemed so firm, so imperturbable,
that she found it restorative merely to look at him,
as weaklings find restorative the sight of those
who are robust. He would chat a little, giving
the latest gossip, telling where last night's ball had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
been held, who had gone upon a journey, who had
got married, but always with that tone of disdain,
that tone of the superior being who sees but is
not moved, and yet who seeks to conceal his boredom,
which was characteristic of him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, he would laugh outright at
the society he moved in, at its pleasures, at its
people, burlesquing and caricaturing them, and
ridiculing himself for being led by them.</p>

<p>"Oh, you!" cried Anna, with an indescribable
intonation of respect.</p>

<p>She listened eagerly to everything he said. Her
fragile soul was like a butterfly that lights on every
tiniest flower. These elegant and meaningless
frivolities, these experiences without depth or significance,
these axioms of a social code that turned
appearances into idols, all this worthless baggage
delighted her enfeebled imagination. Her heart
seemed to care for nothing but little things. She
admired Cesare Dias as a splendid and austere
man whom destiny had thrown amidst inferior
surroundings, and who adapted himself to them
without losing any of his nobler qualities. She
told herself that his was a great soul that had been
born too soon, perhaps too late; he was immeasurably
above his times, yet with quiet fortitude
he took them in good part. When he displayed
his scorn for all human ambitions, speaking of
how transitory everything pertaining to this world
is in its nature; when he derided human folly and
human beings who in the pursuit of follies lose
their fortunes and their reputations; when he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that the only human thing deserving of respect
was success; when he said that all generosity was
born of some secret motive of selfishness, that all
virtue was the result of some weakness of character
or of temperament&mdash;she, immensely impressed,
having forgotten during her fever the emotional
reasons to be opposed to such effete and corrupt
theories, bowed her head, answering sadly, "You
are right."</p>

<p>Now that she was able to sit up they were often
alone together. Laura would leave them to go
and read in the sitting-room, or to receive callers
in the drawing-room, or to walk out with Stella
Martini. She could always find some pretext for
taking herself off. She was a reserved, silent girl,
who knew neither how to live nor how to love as
others did. It was best to leave her to her taste
for silence, for self-absorption. Cesare Dias, a little
anxious about her, asked Anna:</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Laura?"</p>

<p>"She is good&mdash;she is the best girl alive," Anna
answered, with the feeling she always showed when
she named her sister.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias looked at her fixedly. He looked
at her like this whenever her voice betrayed emotion.
It seemed to him that it was her old nature
revealing itself again; he wished to stamp it out,
to suffocate it. Her heart was defenceless, too
impressionable, the heart of a child: he wished to
turn it into a heart of bronze, which would be unaffected
by the breath of passion. Always, therefore,
when Anna allowed her soul to vibrate in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
voice, Cesare Dias, naturally serious and composed
enough, seemed to become more serious, more
austere; his eye hardened into glass, and Anna
felt that she had displeased him. She knew that
she displeased him as often as anything in her
manner could recall that wild adventure which had
sullied the innocence of her girlhood: as often as
she gave any sign of being deeply moved: if she
turned pale, if she bowed her head, if she wept.
Cesare Dias hated all such manifestations of sentimental
weakness. Sometimes, when Anna could
no longer control herself, and her emotion could
not be prevented from shining in her eyes, he would
pretend not to notice it. Sometimes he would
demand, "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said she, timidly conscious that by
her timidity she but displeased him the more.</p>

<p>"Always the same&mdash;incorrigible," he murmured,
shaking his head hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Forgive me; I can't help it," she besought him
with an imploring glance.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't say of anything that you can't
help it. You should be strong enough to govern
yourself in all circumstances," was the axiom of
Cesare Dias.</p>

<p>"I will try."</p>

<p>One day in April, Stella Martini, coming home
from a walk with Laura, brought her some flowers&mdash;some
beautiful wild rosebuds, which in Naples
blossom so early in the year. Anna was seated in
an easy-chair near the window, through which
entered the soft spring air; and when she saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Laura and Stella come into the house&mdash;Laura
dressed in white, breathing peace and youth from
every line of her figure&mdash;Stella with her face that
seemed to have been scalded and shrivelled up by
tears shed long ago, both bearing great quantities
of fresh sweet roses, the poor girl's heart swelled
with indescribable tenderness.</p>

<p>Holding the roses in her hand, she caressed
them, touched them with her face, buried her lips
in them, and said under her voice: "Thank you,
thank you," as if in her weakness she could find
no other words to express her pleasure.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias, arriving a little later, found her in
rapt contemplation over her flowers, her great
fond eyes glowing with joy. A shadow crossed
his face.</p>

<p>"See, they have brought me these flowers," she
said. "Aren't they lovely?"</p>

<p>"I see them," he said, drily.</p>

<p>"Aren't you fond of flowers? They're so fresh
and fragrant. I hope you're fond of them; I
adore them."</p>

<p>And in the fervour of her last phrase she
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that she had doubtless not
so very long ago spoken the same words of a
man; and he realised that, in spite of her illness,
in spite of her repentance, she was ever the same
Anna Acquaviva who had once flown from her
home and people. He lifted his eyebrows, and
his ebony walking-stick beat rather nervously
against his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you like a rose?" she asked, to
placate him.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't care for flowers."</p>

<p>"What! Not even to wear in your button-hole
when you go into society?" she asked, trying to jest.</p>

<p>"They're not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i>. Flowers are pretty
enough in their way; but I assure you I have
never had the weakness to weep over them, or to
say that I adore them."</p>

<p>"I was wrong, I said too much."</p>

<p>"You always say too much. You lack a
sense of proportion. There are a great many
things a girl shouldn't say, lest, if she begins by
saying them, she should end by doing them,
The woman who says too much is lost."</p>

<p>Anna turned as white as the collar of her
frock. It had come at last, the reproof she had
so long been waiting for, and secretly dreading.
He had put it in a single brief sentence. The
woman who says too much is lost. Once upon a
time, six months ago for instance, she would have
endured such a reproof from no one, such a bitter
reference to her past; she would have retorted
hotly, especially if the speaker had been Cesare
Dias. But now! So weakened was she by her
illness and her sorrow, there was not a fibre in
her that resented it; her blood slept in her
veins; her heart contained nothing but penitence.
"The woman who says too much is lost!"
Cesare Dias was right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is true," she said.</p>

<p>And yet, as she said it, a new grief was born
within her, as if she had renounced some precious
possession of her soul, broken some holy vow.</p>

<p>Cesare's face cleared. He had won a victory.</p>

<p>"Anna," he went on, "every time that you
allow yourself to be carried away by sentimentalism,
that you employ exaggerated expressions,
that you indulge in emotional rhetoric, I assure
you, you displease me greatly. How ridiculous if
life were to be passed in saying of people, houses,
landscapes, flowers, 'I adore them!' Don't you
see what a convulsive, hysterical frame of mind
that is? As if life were nothing but a smile, a
tear, a kiss! Do you know to what this sort of
thing inevitably leads? You know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare me, I entreat you."</p>

<p>"I can't, dear. First you must agree with me
that your attitude towards life, though a generous
one if you like, is not a wise one, and that it
leads to the gravest errors. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"You are right."</p>

<p>"You must agree with me that that sort of
thing can only make ourselves and others miserable,
whereas our duty is to be as happy and to
make others as happy as we can. Everything
else is rhetoric. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"You are right. You are always right."</p>

<p>"Finally, you must agree that it is better to be
reasonable than to be sentimental; better to be
arid than to be rhetorical, better to be silent than
to speak out everything that is in one's heart;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
better to be strong than to be weak. Am I not
right?"</p>

<p>"You are right, always right."</p>

<p>"Anna, do you know what life is?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know what it really is."</p>

<p>"Life is a thing which is serious and absurd at
the same time."</p>

<p>She made no answer; she was silent and pensive.</p>

<p>"It is serious because it is the only thing we
know anything about; because every man and
every woman, in whatever rank or condition, is
bound to be honest, well-behaved, worthy and
proper; because if one is rich and noble it is
one's duty to be moral in a given way; if one is
poor and humble, it is one's duty to be moral in
another way."</p>

<p>He saw that she was listening to him eagerly;
he saw that he might hazard a great stroke.</p>

<p>"Giustino Morelli&mdash;&mdash;" he began softly.</p>

<p>"No!" she cried, pressing her hands to her
temples, her face convulsed with terror.</p>

<p>"Giustino Morelli&mdash;&mdash;" he repeated calmly.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't speak of him."</p>

<p>Cesare Dias appeared neither to see nor hear
her. He wished to go to the bottom of the
matter, courageously, pitilessly.</p>

<p>"&mdash;was a serious person, an honest man," he
concluded.</p>

<p>"He was an infamous traitor," said Anna, in a
low voice, as if speaking to herself.</p>

<p>"Anna, he was an honest man. You ought to
believe it. You will believe it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never, never."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will. You ought to do him justice.
I, who am a man, I must do him justice. He
might have issued from his obscurity; he might
have had money, a beautiful wife, a wife whom
he loved, for he loved you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>"Everybody loves in his own way, my dear,"
retorted Cesare, icily. "He loved you. But
because he did not wish to be thought self-interested,
because he did not wish the world to
say of him that he had loved you for your money,
because he did not wish to hear you, Anna, some
day say the same thing; because he could not
endure the accusation of having seduced a young
girl for her fortune; because he was not willing
to let you suffer, as for some years, at any rate,
you would have had to suffer, from poverty and
obscurity, he renounced you. Do you understand?
He renounced you because he was honest. He
renounced you, though in doing so he had to face
your anger and your scorn. My dear, that man
was a martyr to duty, to use one of your own
phrases. Will you allow me to say something
which may appear ungracious, but which is really
friendly?"</p>

<p>Anna consented with a sign.</p>

<p>"Well, you have no just notion of the seriousness
of life. All its responsibilities can be
scattered by a caprice, by a passion, to quote
what you yourself have said. You would brush
aside all obstacles; and you would run the risk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of losing all respect, all honour, all peace, all
health, thereby. Life, Anna, is a very serious
affair."</p>

<p>With a bowed head, she could only answer by
a gesture, a gesture that said "Yes."</p>

<p>"And, at the same time, it's a trifling matter,
Anna."</p>

<p>It was the corrupt, effete nobleman who now
re-appeared, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viveur</i> who had drunk at every
fountain, who was always bored and always
curious; it was he who now took the place of the
moral teacher. Anna looked up, surprised and
shocked.</p>

<p>"Life is absurd, ridiculous, contemptible. The
world is full of cruel parents, of false friends, of
wives who betray their husbands, of husbands
who maltreat their wives, of well-dressed swindlers,
of thieving bankers. All of them in turn are
judges and criminals. All appearances are
deceitful; all faces lie. If by chance there
turns up a man who seems really honest, nobody
believes in him; or, if people believe in him, they
despise him. The man who sacrifices himself,
who makes some great renunciation&mdash;poor
Morelli&mdash;gets nothing but disdain."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;if all this is true?" cried Anna sadly.</p>

<p>"Then, one must have the strength to keep
one's own real feelings hidden; one must wear a
mask; one must take other men and women at
their proper value; one must march straight
forward."</p>

<p>"Whether happy or miserable?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>She put this question with great anxiety, for she
felt that when it was answered her soul's point of
interrogation would be changed to a full stop.</p>

<p>"The strong are happy; the weak are miserable.
Only the strong can triumph."</p>

<p>She was silent, oppressed and pained by his
philosophy, by its bitterness, its sterile pride, its
egotism and cruelty. It seemed as if he had
built a sepulchre from the ruins of her illusions.
She felt that she no longer understood either her
own nature or the external world; a sense of fear
and of confusion had taken the place of her old
principles and aspirations. And there was a
great home-sickness in her heart for love, for
devotion, for tenderness, for enthusiasm; a great
melancholy at the thought that she would never
thrill with them again, that she would never weep
again. She felt a great indefinable longing, not
for the past, not for the present, not for the future,
a longing that related itself to nothing. And she
realised that what Cesare Dias had said was true&mdash;horribly,
dreadfully, certainly true. She could be
sure of nothing after this, she had lost her pole-star,
she was being swept round and round in a
spiritual whirlpool. And he who had led her into
it inspired her with fear, respect, and a vague
admiration. He himself had got beyond the
whirlpool, he was safe in port. Perhaps, in
despair, he had thrown overboard into the furious
waves the most precious part of his cargo;
perhaps he was little better than a wreck; but
what did it matter? He was safe in harbour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>She was not sure whether it was better to brave
out the tempest, to lose everything nobly and
generously for the sake of love, or to save
appearances, make for still waters, and in them
enjoy a selfish tranquillity.</p>

<p>"You are strong?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented.</p>

<p>"And are you happy&mdash;really?"</p>

<p>"Very happy. As happy as one can be."</p>

<p>By-and-by she asked: "Have you always been
happy?"</p>

<p>Cesare Dias did not answer.</p>

<p>"Tell me, tell me, have you always been
happy?"</p>

<p>"What does the past matter? Nothing."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;have you ever loved?"</p>

<p>"The person who says too much is lost; the
person who wants to know too much suffers.
Don't ask."</p>

<p>She chose a rose and offered it to him. He
took it and put it into his button-hole.</p>

<p>At that instant Laura Acquaviva entered the
room.</p>

</div>


<h2>IV.</h2>

<p>At the opening of the San Carlo theatre on
Christmas night the opera was "The Huguenots."</p>

<p>A first night at the San Carlo is always an
event for the Neapolitan public, no matter what
opera, old or new, is given; but when the work
happens to be a favourite the excitement becomes
tremendous.</p>

<p>The two thousand persons, male and female,
who constitute society in that town of half a
million inhabitants, go about for a week beforehand,
from house to house, from café to café,
predicting that the evening will be a success.
The chief rôles in "The Huguenots" were to be
taken by De Giuli Borsi and Roberto Stagno, rôles
in which the public was to hear these artists for
the first time, though they were already known to
everybody, either by reputation or from having
been heard in other operas.</p>

<p>So, on that Christmas Day, the two thousand
members of Neapolitan society put aside their
usual occupations and arranged their time in such
wise as to be ready promptly at eight o'clock, the
men in their dress-suits, the women in rich and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
beautiful evening toilets. Everybody gave up
something&mdash;a walk, a call, a luncheon, a nap&mdash;for
the sake of getting betimes to the theatre.</p>

<p>By half-past seven the approaches to San
Carlo, its portico, its big and little entrances, all
brilliantly lighted by gas, were swarming like
an ant-hill with eager people. Some came on
foot, the collars of their overcoats turned up,
showing freshly shaven faces under their tall silk
opera-hats, or freshly waxed moustaches and
beards newly pointed; others came in cabs; and
before the central door, under the portico, which
was draped with flags, passed a constant stream
of private carriages, depositing ladies muffled
in opera-cloaks of red velvet or white embroidery.</p>

<p>By a quarter past eight the house was full.</p>

<p>Anna and Laura Acquaviva, dressed in white
silk, and accompanied by Stella Martini, occupied
Box No. 19 of the second tier.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias had a place in Box No. 4 of the
first tier.</p>

<p>Anna kept her eyes fixed upon him. He
glanced up at her, but did not bow. He only
turned and spoke a few words to the young man
next to him, who thereupon aimed his opera-glass,
at the girls' box; he was a young gentleman of
medium height, with a blonde beard, and blonde
hair brushed straight back from his forehead.
His brown eyes had an expression of great
kindness.</p>

<p>Anna kept her gaze fixed upon Cesare Dias;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
if now and then she turned it towards the stage it
would only be for a brief moment.</p>

<p>"That is Luigi Caracciolo," said Laura.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Luigi Caracciolo, the man next to Dias."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>And again, Anna turned her face towards Box
No. 4, where Cesare Dias sat with Luigi Caracciolo.
The rest of the theatre hung round her in a sort
of coloured mist; the only thing she clearly saw
was the narrow space where those two men sat
together.</p>

<p>Did they feel the magnetism of her gaze?</p>

<p>Cesare Dias, leaning forward, with his arm on
the red velvet of the railing, was listening to the
music of Meyerbeer; now and then he cast an
absent-minded glance round the audience, the
glance of a man who knows beforehand that he
will find the usual people in the usual places.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo appeared to give little heed to
the music. He was pulling his blonde beard, and
studying the ladies in the house through his opera-glass,
while a slight smile played upon his lips.
Presently he fixed his glass on Anna's box. Had
he felt that magnetism? At any rate, he kept his
glass fixed upon Anna's box.</p>

<p>The curtain fell on the first act.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias spoke a word or two to Luigi, and
the two men rose and left their places.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to Anna as if all the lights
in the theatre had been put out.</p>

<p>"Stagno sang divinely," said Stella Martini.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," responded Laura. "But didn't it strike
you that he rather exaggerated?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't say it did."</p>

<p>Anna did not hear; her eyes were closed.</p>

<p>There was a rumour in the house of moving
people; there was a sound of opening and closing
doors. Fans fluttered, men changed their seats,
people went and came, many of the stalls were
empty. The round of visits had begun.
Husbands and brothers left their boxes to make
place for other men beside their wives and sisters;
to pay their respects to other men's wives and
sisters. There was a babble of many voices idly
chatting. It began in the first and second tiers,
and it rose to the galleries, the stronghold of
students, workmen, and clerks.</p>

<p>Anna gazed sadly at that deserted box below her.</p>

<p>All at once she heard Laura say, "Luigi Caracciolo
and Cesare Dias are with the Contessa
d'Alemagna."</p>

<p>Anna turned round, and raised her opera-glass.</p>

<p>They were there indeed, visiting the beautiful
Countess; Anna could see the pale and noble
face of Cesare Dias, the youthful face of Caracciolo.
The Contessa d'Alemagna was an Austrian, very
clever, very witty. She wore a costume of red
silk, and kept waving a fan of red feathers, as she
talked vivaciously with the two men. She must
have been saying something extremely interesting,
to judge by the close attention with which they
listened to her and by the smiles with which they
responded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>When Anna put down her opera-glass, her face
had become deathly pale.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling ill?" asked Stella Martini.</p>

<p>"No," the child replied, paler than ever.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's too hot here for you. Shall I
open the door of the box?" suggested the
governess.</p>

<p>"Laura, will you change seats with me?" said
Anna.</p>

<p>Laura took Anna's place, and Anna retired to
the back of the box, where she closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better, dear?"</p>

<p>"Thanks. Much better. It was the heat."</p>

<p>And she made as if to return to the front of
the box, but Stella detained her, fearing that the
heat there might again disturb her. So Anna
stopped where she was, breathing the fresh air
that came through the open door.</p>

<p>"Do you like 'The Huguenots,' Stella?" she
asked, for the sake of saying something, in the
hope, perhaps, of thus forgetting her desire to see
what was going on in the box of the Contessa
d'Alemagna.</p>

<p>"Very much. And you?"</p>

<p>"I like it immensely."</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;I am afraid that later on you
may find it too exciting. You know the fourth
act is very terrible. Don't you dread the impression
it may make upon you?"</p>

<p>"It won't matter, Stella," she said, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to go home before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the fourth act begins. If you feel nervous about
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not nervous," she murmured, as if speaking
to herself. "Or, if I am, I'd rather suffer this
way than otherwise."</p>

<p>"We were wrong to come," said Stella, shaking
her head.</p>

<p>"No, no, Stella. Let us stay. I am all right;
I am enjoying it. Don't take me home yet."</p>

<p>And she went back to the front of the box, to
the seat next to Laura's.</p>

<p>"Cesare Dias and Luigi Caracciolo have left
the Contessa d'Alemagna," said Laura.</p>

<p>"Already?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they will come here," suggested Stella
Martini.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. There won't be time," said
Laura.</p>

<p>"There won't be time," assented Anna.</p>

<p>The house had become silent again, in anticipation
of the second act. Here and there some one
who had delayed too long in a box where he was
visiting, would say good-bye quietly, and return to
his place. A few such visitors, better acquainted
with their hosts, remained seated, determined not
to move. Among the latter were, of course, the
lovers of the ladies, the intimate friends of the
husbands.</p>

<p>From her present station Anna Acquaviva
could not look so directly down upon Box No. 4
of the first tier as from her former; she had to
turn round a little in order to see it, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
her interest in it was made manifest. Cesare
Dias and Luigi Caracciolo, after their visit to the
Contessa d'Alemagna, had taken a turn in the
corridor to smoke a cigarette, and had then
returned to their places. Anna, the creature of
her hopes and her desires, could not resist the
temptation to gaze steadily at her guardian,
though she felt that thereby she was drawing
upon herself the attention of all observers, and
exposing her deepest feelings to ridicule and
misconstruction.</p>

<p>And now the divine music of Meyerbeer surged
up and filled the hall, and Anna was conscious of
nothing else&mdash;of nothing but the music and the
face of Cesare Dias shining through it, like a star
through the mist. How much time passed? She
did not know. Twice her sister spoke to her; she
neither heard nor answered.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell again, and Anna issued
from her trance, Laura said, "There is Giustino
Morelli."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Anna, unable to control a contraction
of her features.</p>

<p>But she had self-constraint enough not to ask
"<em>where?</em>" Falling suddenly from a heaven of
rapture to the hard reality of her life, where
traces of her old folly still lingered; hating her
past, and wishing to obliterate it from her memory,
as the motives for it were already obliterated from
her heart, she did not ask where he was. She
covered her face with her fan, and two big tears
rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella Martini looked at her, desiring to speak,
but fearing lest thereby she might only make
matters worse.</p>

<p>At last: "We were wrong to come here, Anna,"
she said.</p>

<p>"No, no," responded Anna. "I am very well&mdash;I
am very happy," she added, enigmatically.</p>

<p>The door of the box was slowly pushed open.
Cesare Dias and Luigi Caracciolo entered. With
a word or two their guardian presented the young
man to the sisters. The men sat down, Cesare
Dias next to Anna, Luigi Caracciolo next to
Laura. They began at once to talk in a light vein
about the performance. Overcoming the tumult
of her heart, Anna alone answered them. Stella
Martini was silent, and Laura, with her eyes half
shut, listened without speaking.</p>

<p>"Stagno is a great artist; he is immensely
talented," observed Luigi Caracciolo, with a bland
smile, passing his fingers slowly through his
blonde beard.</p>

<p>"And so much feeling&mdash;so much sentiment,"
added Anna.</p>

<p>"To say that he is talented, that he is an artist,
is enough," replied Cesare Dias, with an accent in
which severity was tempered by politeness.</p>

<p>Anna assented, bowing her head.</p>

<p>"For the rest, the number of decent opera
singers on the modern stage is becoming less and
less. We have a multitude of mediocrities,
with here and there a star," continued Luigi
Caracciolo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, I have heard the great ones," sighed
Cesare Dias.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. You must have heard Fraschini,
Negrini, and Nourrit in their time," Luigi Caracciolo
said, smiling with the fatuity of a fellow
of twenty who imagines that his youth will last
for ever.</p>

<p>"You were a boy when I heard them, that's a
fact&mdash;which doesn't prevent my being an old man
now," rejoined Cesare Dias, with that shadow of
melancholy in his voice which seemed so inconsistent
with his character.</p>

<p>"What do years matter?" asked Anna, suddenly.
"Other things matter much more; other
things affect us more profoundly, more intimately,
than years. Years are mere external, insignificant
facts."</p>

<p>"Thanks for that kindly defence, my dear,"
Cesare Dias exclaimed, laughing; "but it only
springs from the goodness of your heart."</p>

<p>"From the radiance of youth," said Luigi
Caracciolo, bowing, to underline his compliment.</p>

<p>Anna was silent and agitated. Nothing so
easily upset her equilibrium as light wordly conversation,
based upon personalities and frivolous
gallantry.</p>

<p>"Not enough, not enough," said Cesare Dias,
wishing to cap the compliment, and at the same
time to bring his own philosophy into relief. "As
often as I find myself in the presence of these two
girls, Luigi, who are two flowers of youthfulness, I
seem to feel older than ever. I feel that I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
be a hundred at least. How many changes of
Government have I seen? Eight or nine, perhaps.
Yes, I'm certainly more than a hundred, dear
Anna."</p>

<p>And he turned towards her with a light ironical
smile.</p>

<p>"Why do you say such things&mdash;such sad
things?" murmured Anna.</p>

<p>"Indeed they are sad&mdash;indeed they are. Youth
is the only treasure whose loss one may weep for
the whole of one's life."</p>

<p>"But don't feel badly about it, dear Cesare.
Consider. Isn't knowledge better than ignorance?
Isn't the calm of autumn better than the
storms of spring? You are our master&mdash;the
master of us all. We all revere him, don't we, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signorina</i>?"
said Luigi, turning to Anna.</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Anna's face, and she let the
conversation drop.</p>

<p>"And you, who say nothing, reasonable and
placid Laura?" asked Cesare Dias. "Which is
better&mdash;youth or age? Which is better&mdash;knowledge
or ignorance? Here are knotty problems
submitted to your wisdom, dear Minerva. You
are a young girl, but you are also Minerva. Illuminate
us. Who should be the happier&mdash;I, the
master, or Caracciolo, my pupil?"</p>

<p>Laura thought for a moment, with an intent
expression in her beautiful eyes, and then answered:</p>

<p>"It is best to combine the two&mdash;to have youth
and wisdom together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"The problem is solved!" cried Cesare Dias.</p>

<p>"And the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr'acte</i> is over; everything in its
time. Good evening, good evening; good-bye,
Cesare," said Luigi.</p>

<p>So Caracciolo took his leave, very correctly,
without shaking hands with Dias. Dias had risen,
but Luigi seemed to understand that he meant to
stay in the girls' box.</p>

<p>Anna, who had been looking up anxiously,
waiting, looked down again now, reassured. The
door closed noiselessly upon the young man.</p>

<p>"A pleasant fellow," observed Cesare Dias.</p>

<p>"Very pleasant," agreed Stella Martini, for
politeness' sake, or perhaps because she desired to
state her opinion.</p>

<p>"In my quality of centenarian I feel at liberty
to stop where I am," said Cesare Dias, reseating
himself behind Anna, while beside him, behind
Laura, sat Stella Martini.</p>

<p>"You won't get a good view of the stage from
there," said Stella.</p>

<p>"I don't care to see. It will be enough to hear
it, this fourth act."</p>

<p>Anna said nothing. Courtesy forbade her
looking directly at the scene, for thus she must
have turned her back upon Cesare Dias. It
embarrassed her a little to feel him there behind
her. She did not move. Their two chairs were
close together; and their two costumes made a
striking contrast: his black dress-suit, the modern
and elegant uniform of the man of the world, so
austere and so handsome in its soberness; and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
gown of white silk, the ceremonial robe of a young
girl in society.</p>

<p>She was afraid her arm might touch Cesare's.
He held his opera-hat in his hand. She forbore
to fan herself, lest he might have to change his
position. Now and then she raised her handkerchief
to her lips, as if to refresh them with the
cool linen.</p>

<p>While Saint-Bris, stirred by fanaticism, was
telling the Catholic lords of the excesses of the
Huguenots, and exciting them by his eloquence
to share his fury; while the noble Nevers, the
husband of Valentina, was protesting against the
massacre; while, through the silence of the
theatre, the grand musical poem of hatred, of
wrath, of generosity, of love, and of piety, was
surging up to the fascinated audience, Anna was
thrilling at the thought that Cesare Dias was
looking at her, at her hair, at her lips, at her
person; she felt that she was badly dressed, pale,
awkward, stupid. Wasn't the Contessa d'Alemagna
a thousand times more beautiful than she? The
Contessa d'Alemagna, with her dark complexion
and her blue eyes, and her expression of girlish
ingenuousness deliciously contrasted with womanly
charm; the Contessa d'Alemagna, whom Cesare
Dias had visited before coming to his ward's box.
Weren't there a hundred women of their set
present in the theatre this evening, each of them
lovelier than she? Young girls, smiling brides,
and ladies to whom maturity lent a richer attraction,
all of them acquaintances of Cesare Dias,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
who, from time to time, looked at them through
his opera-glass. And, indeed, her own sister,
the wise Minerva, was she not more beautiful,
more maidenly, more poetical than Anna? Was
it not because of her beauty, her pure profile, her
calm smile, that Cesare had called her by that
gracious name, Minerva?</p>

<p>Anna bowed her head, as if oppressed by the
heat and by the music, but really from a sense of
self-contempt and humiliation. There was a
looking-glass behind her. She was sorry now
that she hadn't made an inspection of herself in it,
on entering the box. She had forgotten her own
face. Fantastically, she imagined it as brown
and scarred, and hideously pallid. Her white
frock made it worse. She registered a silent vow
that she would always hereafter wear black. Only
blonde women could afford to dress in white.</p>

<p>"You have dropped your fan," said Cesare
Dias, stooping to recover it.</p>

<p>He smiled as he handed it to her.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said she, taking the fan.</p>

<p>Presently she put it down on an empty chair
next to her. Cesare Dias picked it up, and
began to fan himself. Then he pressed it to his
face.</p>

<p>"What is it perfumed with?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Heliotrope."</p>

<p>"I like it," he said, and put the fan down.</p>

<p>She was burning with a desire to take it, to
touch what he had touched, but she dared not.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias leaned forward a little, to look at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the stage. He was so close to her, it seemed to
Anna that she could hear him breathe.</p>

<p>For her own part, a sort of intoxication, due no
doubt in some measure to the passionate art of the
great composer, whose music surged like a flood
about her, had mounted from her heart to her
brain; she was conscious of nothing save a great
world of love, save the near presence of Cesare
Dias. Her soul held a new and precious treasure,
a new joy. She delighted herself with the illusion
that the beating of her own heart was the beating
of Cesare's. She forgot everything&mdash;the place,
the time, the future, youth, age, beauty, everything;
motionless, with her eyes cast down, she
seemed to float in a wave of soft warm light,
aware of one single sweet sensation, his nearness
to her. She had forgotten the stage, the people
round her, Stella Martini, her sister Laura; the
music itself was only a distant echo; her whole
being was concentrated in an ecstasy, which she
hoped might never end. She did not dare to
move or speak, lest she might thereby wake from
her heavenly dream. She had again entered anew
into the land of passion. She was one of those
natures which, having ceased to love, begin again
to love.</p>

<p>"I could die like this," she thought.</p>

<p>She felt that she could die thus, in a divine
moment, when new love, young and strong, has not
yet learned the lessons of sorrow, of shame, of
worldly wickedness, that await it; it would be
sweet to die with one's illusions undisturbed, to die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in the fulness of youth, before one's ideals have
begun to decay; to die loving, rather than to live
to see love die.</p>

<p>So, on the stage, Raoul and Valentina, victims
of an irrepressible but impossible passion, were
calling upon Heaven for death, praying to be
allowed to die in their divine moment of love.
Anna, recoiling from the thought of the future,
with its inevitable vicissitudes, struggles, tears, and
disappointments, realised the fascination of death.
Involuntarily, she looked at Cesare. He smiled
upon her, and thereat she too smiled, like his
faithful image in a mirror. And her sublime longing
to die, disappeared before the reality of his
smile.</p>

<p>She looked at him again, but this time he was
intent upon the scene. Anna felt that her love
was being sung for her by the artists there, by
Raoul and Valentina.</p>

<p>Cesare said to her, "How beautiful it is!"</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," she murmured, bowing her
head.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that his voice had been unusually
soft. What was the reason? What
commotion was taking place in his heart? She
asked herself these questions, but could not answer
them. She loved him. That was enough. She
loved him; she could not hope to be loved by
him.</p>

<p>The music ceased. The curtain fell.</p>

<p>"Have you ordered the carriage?" Cesare Dias
asked of Stella Martini.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, for twelve o clock.</p>

<p>"If you'll wait for me a moment I'll go and
get my overcoat."</p>

<p>The ladies were putting on their cloaks, when
Cesare came back, wearing his hat and overcoat.
He helped Stella on with hers, then Laura, then
Anna.</p>

<p>And looking at the sisters, he said, "You ought
to have your portraits painted, dressed like this. I
assure you, you're looking extremely handsome. I
speak as a centenarian."</p>

<p>Laura smiled; Anna looked down, embarrassed.
Her trouble was increased when she saw Cesare
politely offer his arm to Stella Martini. Had she
hoped that he would offer it to <em>her</em>? He motioned
to the girls to take the lead in leaving the box.
Anna put her arm through Laura's and went out
slowly.</p>

<p>He conducted them to their carriage, and when
they were safely in it, "I shall walk," he said,
"It's such a fine evening. Good-night."</p>

<p>In the darkness, as they drove home, Laura
asked, "Did you see Giustino Morelli?"</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't there."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? He <em>was</em> there."</p>

<p>"For me, he wasn't there. Giustino Morelli is
dead."</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<p>Cesare Dias encouraged the attentions which his
young friend Luigi Caracciolo was paying to his
ward Anna Acquaviva. He encouraged them
quietly, with the temperance which he showed in
all things, not with the undisguised eagerness of a
father anxious to marry off his daughter.</p>

<p>And yet he was certainly anxious to marry her
off. He was anxious to hand his responsibilities over
to a husband, to confide to the care of another the
safeguarding of that ardent and fragile soul, which
threatened at any moment to fall into emotional
errors. A thousand symptoms that could not
escape his observant eye, kept him in a state of
secret nervousness about her. It was true, nevertheless,
that she had greatly changed for the better.
Thanks to his constant watchfulness, to his habit
of reproving her whenever she betrayed the impulsive
side of her nature, to his sarcasm, to his
biting speech, she had indeed greatly changed in
manner.</p>

<p>A desire to obey him, to please him, a painless
resignation, a loving humility, showed themselves
in everything she said and did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw that she was making mighty efforts to
dominate the impetuousness of her character; he
saw that she listened with close attention to his
talk, trying to reconcile herself to those perverse
theories of his which pained her mortally. That
was what he called giving her a heart of bronze,
strengthening her against the snares and delusions
of the world. If he could but deprive her of all
capacity for enthusiasm he would thereby deprive
her of all capacity for suffering, as well.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias congratulated himself upon this
labour of his, glorifying himself as a sort of creator,
who had known how to make over the most refractory
of all metals, human nature. And yet
his mind was not quite at ease.</p>

<p>Her docility, her obedience, her self-control,
roused his suspicions. He began to ask himself
whether the girl might not be a monster of
hypocrisy, whether under her tranquil surface she
might not still be on fire within.</p>

<p>But had she not always been a model of sincerity?
Her very faults, had they not sprung
from the truthfulness and generosity of her nature?</p>

<p>No; the hypothesis of hypocrisy was untenable.
Cesare Dias was far too intelligent to
believe that the intimate essence of a soul can
undergo alteration. It was impossible that a
soul so essentially truthful as Anna's should suddenly
become hypocritical.</p>

<p>And yet he was not easy in his mind.</p>

<p>What profound reason, what occult motive,
could be at the bottom of Anna's change of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
front? What was it that enabled her and persuaded
her to withhold her tears, suppress her sobs,
and master the ardour of her temperament?</p>

<p>Ah, no! Cesare Dias was not easy in his mind.
He knew the strength of his own will, he understood
his own power to rule people and to impose
his wishes upon them; but that was not enough
to account for the conditions that puzzled him.
There must be something else.</p>

<p>He was not anxious about Laura. The wise
and beautiful Minerva he could marry whenever
he liked, to whomsoever he liked. He was sure
that Laura would be able to take care of herself.
He held the opinion, common to men of forty,
that marriage was the only destiny proper for a
young girl. And it was only by means of a marriage
that he would be able to relieve himself of
his weight of responsibility in respect of Anna
Acquaviva.</p>

<p>So, as often as he decently could, he brought
meetings to pass between Luigi Caracciolo and
his wards: sometimes at the theatre, sometimes
in the Villa Nazionale, sometimes at parties
and dances; indeed, it would seldom happen that
Cesare would speak to the girls in public, without
the handsome young Luigi Caracciolo appearing a
few minutes later.</p>

<p>There was probably a tacit understanding between
the two men.</p>

<p>Anna seemed to be unconscious of what was
going on. Whenever her guardian approached
her, presenting himself with that elegant manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
which was one of his charms, she welcomed him
with a luminous smile, giving him her hand,
gazing at him with brilliant, joyful eyes, listening
eagerly to what he had to say, and by every action
showing him her good-will. And when, in turn,
Luigi Caracciolo followed, she gave him a formal
handshake, and exchanged a few words with him,
distantly, coldly. He would try his hardest to
shine before her, to bring the talk round to subjects
with which he was familiar; but their interviews
were always so short! At the theatre,
between the acts; at the Villa, walking together for
ten minutes at the utmost; at a ball, during a
quadrille; and always in the presence of Laura, or
Stella, or the Marchesa Scibilla, the girls' distant
cousin, who often chaperoned them; and always
watched from afar by their guardian Cesare Dias.</p>

<p>The relations between Luigi Caracciolo and
Anna Acquaviva were such as, save in rare exceptional
cases, always exist between people of the
aristocracy. They were founded upon conventionality
tempered by a certain amount of sympathy.
The rigorous code of our nobility forbids anything
approaching intimacy. Luigi Caracciolo's courtship
of Anna was precisely like that of every other
young man of his world. During the Carnival, it
became a little more pressing, perhaps; he began
to take on the appearance of a man in love. It
seemed as if he invented pretexts for seeing her
every day.</p>

<p>Willingly or unwillingly, Cesare Dias was his
accomplice. Luigi was becoming more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
attentive. If Anna mentioned a book, he would
send it to her, with a note; he would underline
the sentimental passages, and when he met her
again would ask her opinion upon it. If she
mentioned a friend of her childhood, he would
interest himself in all the particulars of the
friendship. He was burning to know something
about her first love affair; he had heard it vaguely
rumoured that she had had one, that it had
ended unhappily, and been followed by a violent
illness.</p>

<p>And, indeed, from the way in which she would
sometimes suddenly turn pale, from certain intonations
of her voice, from her habit of going off
into day-dreams when something said or done
seemed to suggest old memories to her, it was easy
for him to see that she must have passed through
some immense emotional experience, and suffered
from some terrible shock. She had a secret!
Behind her great black eyes, behind her trembling
lips, behind her silence, she hid a secret.</p>

<p>Luigi was in love with her, in his own way; not
very deeply in love, but in love.</p>

<p>If Cesare Dias, in Anna's hearing, spoke of love,
of the folly of passion, of the futility of hope, the
girl bowed her head, listening without replying, as
if she considered Cesare the infallible judge of all
things.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo saw this, and it tormented him
with curiosity. Once he openly asked Dias if
Anna had not already been in love. Dias, with
the air of a man of the world, answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she was interested in a young man, a
decent young fellow, who behaved very well."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they marry?"</p>

<p>"The young man was poor."</p>

<p>"Was she very fond of him?"</p>

<p>"A mere girlish fancy."</p>

<p>"And now she has quite forgotten him?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, absolutely."</p>

<p>This dialogue relieved Luigi for a moment; but
he soon felt that it could not have contained the
whole truth. He felt that the whole truth could
only be told by Anna Acquaviva herself. And
when he was alone with her he longed to question
her on the subject, but his questions died unspoken
on his lips.</p>

<p>Luigi's attentions to her had by this time
become so apparent, and Cesare's manner was so
much that of a father desirous of giving his
consent to the betrothal of his daughter, that
Anna could no longer pretend not to understand.
Sometimes, when Cesare would come up to her,
arm in arm with his young friend, she would look
into his eyes with an expression which seemed to
ask, "Oh, why are you doing this?"</p>

<p>He would appear not to notice this silent
appeal. He knew very well that to attain his
object he would have to overcome tremendous
obstacles; that to persuade Anna Acquaviva to
marry Luigi Caracciolo would be like taking a
strong fortress. But he was a determined man,
and he had determined to succeed. He saw her
humility, he saw how she lowered her eyes before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
him, he felt that in most things she would be wax
under his hand. But he was not at all sure that
she would obey him when it came to a question of
love, when it came to a question of her marriage.
She might again rebel, as she had already
rebelled.</p>

<p>Anna felt a latent irritation at perceiving
Luigi's intentions and Cesare's approval of them,
and she revenged herself by adopting towards the
young man a demeanour of haughty politeness,
against which he was defenceless. She took
pleasure in contradicting him. If he seemed
sentimental&mdash;and he was often sentimental in his
way, which involved an element of sensuality&mdash;she
became ironical, uttering paradoxes against
sentiment in general; her voice grew hard; she
seemed almost cynical. From sheer amiability
Luigi Caracciolo always ended by agreeing with
her, but it was easy to see that in doing so he was
obeying his affection for her; he had quite the air
of saying that she was right, not because he was
convinced, but because she was a charming woman
of whom he was devotedly fond.</p>

<p>"You agree with me for politeness' sake. What
weakness!" she said angrily, with the impatience
that women take no pains to conceal from men
whom they don't like.</p>

<p>The slight smile with which Luigi assented to
this proposition, and implied, moreover, that
weakness born of a desire to please a loved one,
was not altogether reprehensible, annoyed her
more than ever. Anna wished the whole exterior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
world to keep tune to her own ruling thought,
and anybody who by any means prevented such a
harmony became odious to her. Such an one was
Luigi Caracciolo.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias, with his acute insight, watched the
couple rather closely. And when he saw Anna
trying to avoid a conversation with Luigi, refusing
to dance with him, or receiving him with scant
courtesy, a slight elevation of his eyebrows testified
to his discontent.</p>

<p>One day, when she had turned her back upon
the young man at a concert, Cesare Dias, coming
up, said to her, "You appear to be treating
Caracciolo rather badly, Anna."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she replied, trembling at his
harsh tone.</p>

<p>"I think so," he insisted. "And I beg you to
be more civil to him."</p>

<p>"I will obey you," she answered.</p>

<p>For several days after that she seemed very
melancholy. Laura, who continued to sleep in
the same room with her, often heard her sighing
at night in her bed. Two or three times she had
asked a little anxiously, "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing. Go to sleep," Anna replied.</p>

<p>On the next occasion of her meeting Caracciolo,
she treated him with exaggerated gentleness, in
which, however, the effort was very apparent. He
took it as so much to the good. She persevered
in this behaviour during their next few interviews,
and then she asked Dias, triumphantly:
"Am I doing as you wish?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"In what respect?"</p>

<p>"In respect of Caracciolo."</p>

<p>"Do you need my approbation?" he asked, in
surprise. "For politeness' sake alone you should
be civil to the young man."</p>

<p>"But it was you who told me to be so," she
stammered meekly.</p>

<p>"I merely told you what a young lady's duty
is&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>She bent her head contritely. She had made
a great effort to please Cesare Dias, and this was
all the recognition she got. However, she could
not feel towards him the least particle of anger;
and the result was that her dislike of Luigi
Caracciolo took a giant's stride.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo's name was in everybody's
mouth; everybody talked about him to her&mdash;Laura,
Stella Martini, the Marchesa Scibilla. She
shrugged her shoulders, without answering. Her
silence seemed like a consent; but it is easy to
guess that it was really only a means of concealing
her unpleasant thoughts.</p>

<p>When, however, it was her guardian who mentioned
Caracciolo, vaunting not only his charm,
but also the seriousness of his character, she
became excessively nervous. She looked at him
in surprise, wondering that he could speak thus of
such a disagreeable and vulgar person, and smiling
ironically.</p>

<p>One day, overcome by impatience, she asked:
"But do you really take him so seriously?"</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;Caracciolo?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;Caracciolo."</p>

<p>"I take every man seriously, who deserves it;
and he does, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to contradict you," she said,
softly; "but that is not my opinion."</p>

<p>"Have you really an opinion on the subject?"
he responded, with a slight inflexion of contempt.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I have an opinion."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Why, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The opinions of young girls don't count, my
dear. You are very intelligent; there's no doubt
of that. But you know absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>"But, after all," she exclaimed, "do you really
wish to persuade me that Caracciolo is a clever
man?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"That he has a heart?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he answered, curtly.</p>

<p>"That he is sympathetic?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he repeated for the third time.</p>

<p>"Well, well," she said, disconcerted. "I find
him arid in mind, hard of heart, and often absurd
in his manners. No one will ever convince me of
the contrary. He's a doll, not a man. Such a
creature a man! It doesn't require much knowledge
to see through <em>him</em>!"</p>

<p>"It is quite unnecessary to discuss it, my dear,"
said Cesare Dias, icily. "We won't discuss it
farther. I'm not anxious to convince you, and it
doesn't matter. Think what you like of anybody.
It's not my affair to correct your fancies. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
unlimited indulgence still at your disposal for
your extravagances; but there's one thing I can't
tolerate&mdash;ingratitude. Do you understand&mdash;I
hate ingratitude?"</p>

<p>"But what do you mean?" she cried, in anguish.</p>

<p>"Nothing more. Good night."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and went away. For
ten days he did not reappear in the Acquaviva
household. He had never before let so long an
interval pass without calling, unless he was out of
town. Stella Martini, not seeing him, ingenuously
sent to ask how he was. He replied, through his
servant, that his health was perfect and that he
thanked her for her concern.</p>

<p>In reality, he was furious because in his first skirmish
with Anna on the subject of Luigi Caracciolo
she had beaten him; furious, not only because
of the wounds his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i> had received, but
because his schemes for the girl's marriage were
delayed. His anger was mixed with certain very
lively suspicions, lively, though as yet not altogether
clear in substance. It was impossible that
Anna's conduct should not be due to some secret
motive. He began at last to wonder whether she
was still in love with Giustino Morelli.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he refrained from calling upon her,
well aware that in dealing with women no method
is more efficacious than to let them alone. And,
indeed, Anna was already sorry for what she had
said, not because it wasn't true, but because she
felt that she had thereby offended Cesare Dias,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
perhaps very deeply. But what could she do,
what could she do? That Cesare Dias should
plead with her for another man! It was too
much. She felt that she must no longer trust to
time; she must take decisive action at once.</p>

<p>Cesare's absence caused her great bitterness.
Her regret for what she had said was exceedingly
sharp during the first few days. She realised that
she had been wrong, at least in manner. She
ought to have held her tongue when she saw his
face darken, and heard his voice tremble with
scorn. Instead, in her foolish pride, she had held
up her head, and spoken, and offended him. For
two days, and during the long watches of two
nights, stifling her sobs so that Laura should not
hear them, she had longed to write him a little
note to ask his pardon; but then she had feared
that that might increase his irritation. Mentally,
she was constantly on her knees before him, begging
to be forgiven, as a child begs, weeping. She
believed, she hoped he would come back; on his
entrance she would press his hand and whisper a
submissive word of excuse. She had not yet
understood what a serious thing his silent vengeance
could be.</p>

<p>He did not call. And now a dumb grief began
to take the place of Anna's contrition, a dumb,
aching grief that nothing could assuage, because
everything reminded her of its cause, his absence.
Whenever she heard a door opened, or the sound
of a carriage stopping in the street before the
house, she trembled. She had no peace. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
accused him of injustice. Why was he so unjust
towards her, towards <em>her</em> who ever since that
fatal day at Pompeii had only lived to obey him?
Why did he punish her like this, when her only
fault had been that she saw the insignificance, the
nullity, of Luigi Caracciolo? Every hour that passed
intensified her pain. In her reserve she never
spoke of him. Stella Martini said now and again,
"Signor Dias hasn't called for a long time. He
must be busy."</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied Laura, absently.</p>

<p>"No doubt," assented Anna, in a weak voice.</p>

<p>She was burning up with anxiety, with heartache,
with suspicion, and with jealousy. Yes, with
jealousy. It had never occurred to her that Cesare
might have some secret love in his life, as other
men have their secret loves, and as he would be
especially likely to have his, for he was rich and
idle. In her ingenuousness and ignorance, it had
never occurred to her. It was as if other women
didn't exist, or as if, existing, they were quite
unworthy of his interest. But now it did occur to
her. In the darkness of his absence the thought
came to her, and took possession of her; and sometimes
it seemed so infinitely likely, that she could
scarcely endure it.</p>

<p>It was more than probable that amongst all the
beautiful women of his acquaintance there was one
whom he loved. It was with her that he passed
his hours&mdash;his entire days, perhaps. That was
why Anna never saw him! At the end of a week
her distress had become so turbulent, that her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
head reeled, as it used to reel when she thought of
flying with Giustino Morelli. As it used to reel
then? Nay, more, worse than then.</p>

<p>In those days she had not felt the consuming
fires of jealousy, fires that destroy for ever the
purest joys of love. In those days the man she
cared for was so absolute in his devotion to her,
she had not tasted the bitterness of jealousy, a
bitterness beyond the bitterness of gall and wormwood,
a poison from whose effects those who truly
love never recover.</p>

<p>But who was she, the woman that so powerfully
attracted Cesare as to make him forget his child!
The Contessa d'Alemagna, perhaps. Yes, it must
be she&mdash;that dark lady, with the blue eyes, the
wonderful toilets, the youthful colour, the vivacious
manner; she was indeed an irresistible enchantress.
Poor Anna! During Cesare's absence she learned
all the phases of hope and fear, of torturing
jealousy, of wretched loneliness. He did not come
he did not come; perhaps he would never come
again. What had he said? That he detested
ingratitude, that he despised people who were
ungrateful. Ungrateful&mdash;she! But how could he
expect her to thank him for wishing to marry her
to Luigi Caracciolo? Was she really ungrateful?</p>

<p>Three or four times she had written to him,
begging him to come; now a simple little note;
now a long passionate letter, full of contradictions,
wherein, to be sure, the word "love" never
appeared, but where it could be read between the
lines; now a frank, short love-letter: but each in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
turn had struck her as worse than the others, as
more trivial, more ineffectual; and she had ended
by tearing them to pieces.</p>

<p>It was she who had put it into Stella Martini's
head to send to inquire how he was; his curt
response to that inquiry struck a chill to her
heart: he was in town, and he was well. Then
she would go out for long walks with Stella, in
the hope of meeting him.</p>

<p>One afternoon in February, at last, she did
meet him, thus, in the street.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said, nervously.</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>"It's a long while since we have seen you," said
Stella Martini.</p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed it."</p>

<p>"You haven't called for many days," said Anna,
looking into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Many?"</p>

<p>"Eight days."</p>

<p>"Eight. Really? Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I have counted them," she said, turning away
her head, as if to look at the sea.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that's a great compliment." And he
bowed gallantly.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a compliment. It was affection, it
was gratitude."</p>

<p>"Good. I see you're in a better frame of mind.
I'll call to-morrow."</p>

<p>When he had left them, Anna and Stella went
on towards the Mergellina, walking more rapidly
than before. Anna kept looking at the sea, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a slight smile upon her lips, a new colour in her
cheeks. She buried her hands in her muff. Had
he not pressed one of those hands at parting with
her? Now and then she would look backwards,
as if expecting to see him again; it was the hour
of the promenade. She did see him again, indeed;
but this time he was in a carriage, a smart trap of
the Viennese pattern, driven dashingly by Luigi
Caracciolo.</p>

<p>She saw them approaching from afar, swiftly.
She bowed and smiled to both of them. Her
smile was luminous with happiness; and Luigi
Caracciolo imagined himself the cause of it, and
drove more slowly; and Cesare Dias was pleased
by it, for he took it as an earnest of her better
frame of mind.</p>

<p>When Stella Martini asked her, "Shall we continue
our walk or go home?" she answered, "Let
us go home."</p>

<p>She had seen him; she had told him how
anxiously she had counted the days of his
absence; he had promised that he would call
to-morrow. She had seen him again, and had
smiled upon him. That was enough. She mustn't
ask too much of Providence in a single day.</p>

<p>Anna went home as happy as if she had
recovered a lost treasure. And yet Cesare Dias
had been cold and distant. But what did that
matter to Anna? She had got back her treasure;
that was all. Again she would enjoy his dear
presence, she would hear his voice, she would sit
near to him, she would speak with him, answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
him; he would come again every day, at his
accustomed hour; she could please herself with
the fancy that that hour was sacred to him, as it
was to her. Nothing else mattered. It was true
that she had met him by the merest chance; it
was true, that had chance ordered otherwise, a
fortnight might have passed without her seeing
him. It was true, that he had taken no pains to
bring about their meeting. It was true, also, that
she and Stella had as much as begged him to call
upon them. But in all this he had been so like
himself, his conduct had been so characteristic,
that Anna was glad of it. It was a great thing to
have made her peace with him, without having
had to write to him.</p>

<p>"Signor Dias was looking very well," said
Stella Martini, "we shall see him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow," said Anna, smiling.</p>

<p>"I missed him immensely during his long
absence."</p>

<p>"So did I."</p>

<p>"You're very fond of him, aren't you?" Stella
inquired ingenuously.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Anna, after a little hesitation.</p>

<p>"He's so good&mdash;in spite of the things he says,"
observed the governess.</p>

<p>"He is as he is," murmured Anna, with a
gesture.</p>

<p>When they got home, Laura noticed Anna's
air of radiant joy. Anna moved about the room,
without putting by her hat or muff.</p>

<p>At last she said, "You know, we met Dias."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah?" responded Laura, without interest.</p>

<p>"He's very well."</p>

<p>"That's nothing extraordinary."</p>

<p>"He's coming to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>But when he arrived the next day, it was Laura
who received him. Anna, at the sound of the bell,
had taken refuge in her own room.</p>

<p>"Oh, wise Minerva!" cried Dias, pressing her
little white hand. "You are well. You are natural.
You know no weakness. You, I am sure, haven't
been counting the days of my absence. I understand.
I am wise, too. We are like the Seven
Sages of Greece."</p>

<p>She responded with a smile. Cesare Dias looked
at her admiringly. Then Anna came. She was
embarrassed; and red and white alternated in her
cheek. She spoke nervously, and kept her eyes
inquiringly fixed upon Cesare's face. He, on the
other hand, was calm and superior. He behaved
as if he had never been away. He had the good
sense not to mention Luigi Caracciolo; and Anna,
who was waiting for that name as for an occasion
to show her submissiveness, was disconcerted.
Dias appeared to have forgotten the ingratitude
with which he had reproached her. He had the
countenance of a man too magnanimous to bear a
grudge. And Anna was more than ever disconcerted
by such unmerited generosity. For several
days he did not speak of Caracciolo; then, noticing
how Anna said yes to every remark he made,
little by little he began to reintroduce the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Little by little Caracciolo regained his position,
became a new, an important member of their
group. He returned to the attack, encouraged by
the smile he had received that day in the Mergellina.
His manner was more devoted than ever.
He treated the girl as a loved object before whom
he could pass his life kneeling. She could not
control a movement of dislike at first seeing him,
because it was he who had occasioned her quarrel
with Cesare Dias; but Luigi did not notice it; and
she soon got herself in hand, determined to treat
him as kindly as she possibly could. It was a
sacrifice she was making to please Cesare Dias.
She closed her eyes to shut out the vision of the
peril towards which she was advancing. She compromised
herself with Luigi Caracciolo day after
day. She compromised herself as a girl does only
with the man she means to marry; accepting
flowers from him, answering his notes, listening to
his compliments; and at night, when she was
alone, she would tremble with anger and with self-contempt,
counting the steps she had made during
the afternoon towards the great danger! But the
fear of seeing Cesare Dias again absent himself
for eight days, the fear that he might again pass
eight days at the feet of the Contessa d'Alemagna,
or at those of some other beautiful woman&mdash;this
fear rendered her so weak that she went on, not
knowing where she might stop, feeling that she was
approaching the most terrible crisis of her life.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias, somewhat easier in his mind about
the girl appeared to be pleased in a fatherly way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
by her conduct; it seemed as if he was watching
his chance to speak the decisive word. Anna,
dreading that word, had got into an overwrought
nervous condition, where her humour changed from
minute to minute. Now she would cry, now she
would laugh, now she would blush, now she would
turn pale.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Dias.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered, passing her hand over
her eyes.</p>

<p>But at his question she smiled radiantly, and
he felt that he had worked a little miracle.</p>

<p>He was a clever man, and he knew that he
must strike while the iron was hot. He must
attack Anna in one of her moments of meekness,
or not at all. Luigi Caracciolo became more and
more pressing; he loved the girl, and he told her
so in every look he gave her. And time was flying.
Everybody who met Anna congratulated her
upon her engagement; and when she replied:
"No, I'm not engaged," people shook their heads,
smiling sceptically.</p>

<p>One afternoon, angry with Caracciolo because
of a letter he had written to her, and which he
insisted upon her answering, she said to Dias,
who was talking with Laura:</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Good. And I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;will you call to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes. In the morning."</p>

<p>He returned to his conversation with Laura.</p>

<p>All night long she prayed for strength and courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>And when, the next morning, she was alone
with him, too frightened to speak, she simply
handed him Caracciolo's letter. He took it, read
it, and silently returned it.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, as if he did not wish to
express an opinion.</p>

<p>"Does it strike you as a serious letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's serious."</p>

<p>"I may easily be mistaken," she said. "That
is why I want to ask your advice. You&mdash;you
know so much."</p>

<p>"A little," he assented, smiling.</p>

<p>They spoke very quietly, seated side by side,
without looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he strike you as bold?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Who? Caracciolo? For having written that
letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No. People in love are always writing
letters. They don't always send them, but they
always write them."</p>

<p>"Ah, is that so?"</p>

<p>"He loves you, therefore he writes to you."</p>

<p>"He loves me?" she inquired, trembling.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Has he told you so?"</p>

<p>"He has told me so."</p>

<p>"And what did you answer?"</p>

<p>"I? Nothing. He asked me nothing. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
merely announced a fact. It's from you that he
expects an answer."</p>

<p>"From me?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Every letter calls for an answer."</p>

<p>"I shan't answer this one."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I have nothing to say to him."</p>

<p>"Don't you love him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Not even a little? Don't you like him?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't love him, I don't even like him."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," he said, very gravely, as if
he saw before him an insurmountable obstacle.</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself then," said she.</p>

<p>"I see that you receive him kindly, that you
speak to him politely, that you listen to his
compliments, apparently with pleasure. That's a
great deal for a young girl to do." And he lifted
his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I have done it to please you&mdash;because he is a
friend of yours," she cried.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he cried, curtly.</p>

<p>Then befell a silence. She played with an
antique coin attached to her watch-chain, and kept
her eyes cast down.</p>

<p>"So," he began presently, "so you won't marry
Luigi Caracciolo?"</p>

<p>"No. Never."</p>

<p>"He's a splendid fellow, though. He has a
noble name, a handsome fortune. And he loves
you."</p>

<p>"I don't love him, and I won't marry him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Love isn't necessary in marriage," said Cesare
coldly.</p>

<p>"Not for others, perhaps. For me it is necessary,"
she cried, pained in the bottom of her heart
by this apothegm.</p>

<p>"You know nothing about life, my dear. A
marriage for love and a marriage for convenience
are equally likely to turn out happily or unhappily.
And of what use is passion? Of
none."</p>

<p>She bowed her head, not convinced, obstinate in
her faith, but respecting the man who spoke to her.</p>

<p>"If you don't care for Luigi Caracciolo, you
ought to try not to see him."</p>

<p>"I will avoid him."</p>

<p>"But he will seek you."</p>

<p>"I'll stay in the house."</p>

<p>"He'll write to you."</p>

<p>"I have already said I won't answer him."</p>

<p>"He will persevere; I know him. The prize
at stake is important. He will persevere."</p>

<p>"You will tell him that the marriage is impossible."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, my dear. I shan't be the bearer of
any such ungracious message."</p>

<p>"Aren't you&mdash;aren't you my guardian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am your guardian. But I heartily
wish Francesco Acquaviva had not chosen me.
Frankly, I would prefer to be nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Am I&mdash;so bad?" she pleaded, with tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you are good or bad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I don't waste my time trying to make such distinctions.
I only know that he's a fine young
fellow, handsome and rich, who loves you, and
that you, without a single earthly reason, refuse
him. I know that he is anxious to marry you,
in spite of the fact that you don't care for him, in
spite of&mdash;pass me the word&mdash;in spite of the
extravagance of your character. Excuse me, dear
Anna, but I want to ask you whether you think it
will be easy to find another husband?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?"</p>

<p>"I ask, do you think another will be likely to
ask you for your hand?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me. I don't understand," she said,
turning pale, because she did understand.</p>

<p>"My dear, have you forgotten the past?"</p>

<p>"What past?" she demanded, proudly.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a flight from home, my dear. A
day passed at Pompeii with a young man. Nothing
else."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens!" she sobbed, burying her face
in her hands.</p>

<p>"Don't cry out, Anna. This is a serious
moment. You must control yourself. Remember
that what you did respectable girls don't do.
Luigi Caracciolo knows nothing about it, or
nothing definite. But a man who did know
about it, wouldn't marry you, my dear. It's hard;
it's cruel; but it's my duty to tell it to you.
Marry him; marry Luigi. That is the advice of
a friend, of a true friend, Anna. Marry Luigi
Caracciolo."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I committed a great fault," she said, in a dull
voice, "but haven't you forgiven me, you and
Laura?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. But husbands&mdash;but young men
about to marry, don't pardon such faults. With
what jealous care I have kept that secret! I
have guarded it as if I were your father. And
now you let a chance like this slip away! Not
realising that such a chance may never come
again! But another man, an equal of Caracciolo,
where is he to be found?"</p>

<p>"It is true that I committed a great fault," she
said, returning always to the same idea; "but my
honour was untouched."</p>

<p>"I am the only person who knows that."</p>

<p>"It is enough for me that you know it."</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, you're a foolish child; that's
what you are. You fall in love with a penniless
nobody, you escape from your home, you risk your
honour, and you are saved by a miracle. Afterwards,
you are ill, you get well, you forget the
young beggar; and then when a fine fellow like
Caracciolo falls in love with you, you refuse him.
You're mad, Anna. Marry Luigi Caracciolo. I
beg you to marry him."</p>

<p>"You can't ask me that," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Love is a fancy. Marry Caracciolo."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"But why not? It's not a sufficient reason to
say that you don't love him."</p>

<p>"Look for another reason, then," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll find it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Cesare Dias had spoken these words in a
threatening tone, unusual to him. He rarely lost
his temper.</p>

<p>After a long pause he asked, smiling sarcastically,
"You are in love with some one else, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Anna did not answer. She wrung her hands
and hid her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer? You've fallen in love
again, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Again? What do you mean?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I mean that to explain your refusal of Luigi
Caracciolo, you must be in love with some other
man. You little girls believe that passion is
everlasting. You believe in faithfulness that lasts,
if not beyond the grave, at least up to its brink.
Are you still in love with Giustino Morelli?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't insult me like that," she cried, in a
convulsion of sobs.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," said he, studying her with cold
curiosity, while she wept.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, don't think that of me," she
besought him; "Say anything that I deserve, but
not that, not that."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," repeated Dias. "We will
speak of this another day."</p>

<p>"Listen, listen," she cried. "Don't go away
yet. Forgive me, first, for having interfered with
one of your plans. But marry Luigi Caracciolo&mdash;I
can't, indeed I can't. I never can. You smile
at my word <em>never</em>. You are right, the human
heart is such a fickle thing. Forgive me. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
you will see that I am not wrong. You will
never never have any more trouble with me. I
will be so obedient, so meek. I will do everything
you wish. Compared to you I am such a
little, poor, worthless thing."</p>

<p>She was weeping. Giustino Morelli and Luigi
Caracciolo had disappeared from the conversation;
only Cesare Dias and Anna Acquaviva remained
in it. He listened with growing curiosity. If in
one sense he had lost a battle, in another his
vanity had gained a victory. A smile passed over
his face.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me cry. I am so unhappy, so
miserable. I have played away my life so
foolishly. But I didn't know. I swear to you, I
didn't understand. Now all is over. I am a lost
woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't exaggerate."</p>

<p>"Oh, you yourself said it. You are right. A
respectable girl, who holds dear her honour, who
is jealous of her reputation, doesn't fly from her
home, doesn't throw herself into the arms of a
man. You are right&mdash;you only&mdash;you are always
right&mdash;you who are so wise. But if you knew&mdash;if
you knew what it is like, this madness that
springs up from my heart to my brain&mdash;if you
knew how I lose my head, when my feelings get
the better of me&mdash;you would be sorry for me."</p>

<p>"Don't cry any more," he said, very low.</p>

<p>"Ah, if tears could only wash out the past," she
sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye, Anna," he said, rising.</p>

<p>"Don't go away." And she took his hand.
"I haven't said anything to you yet. I haven't
explained. You are going away angry with me.
But you are right. The sooner it is finished the
better. To-day I have no strength. I irritate
you. Women who make scenes are always tiresome.
But you ought to know, you ought. I
will write to you&mdash;I will write everything. You
permit me to, don't you? Say that you permit
me. I can't live unless you let me write and tell
you everything."</p>

<p>"Write," he said, softly.</p>

<p>"And you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive. Write. Good-bye,
Anna."</p>

<p>She sat down. Dias went away. Laura and
Stella came into the room.</p>

<p>"Well, is the marriage arranged?" asked Stella,
not noticing Anna's red eyes and pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"No. It will never be arranged."</p>

<p>An hour later Laura asked: "Are you in love
with Cesare Dias?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Anna, simply.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>

<p>Anna's letter to Cesare Dias ran thus:</p>

<p>"I don't know what name to call you by,
whether by your own name, so soft and proud, or
whether by that of Friend, which says so much,
and yet says nothing. I don't know whether I
should write here the word that my respect for
you imposes upon me, or the word that my heart
inspires. Perhaps I had better call you by no
name at all; perhaps I ought not to struggle
against the unconquerable superior will that dominates
me. I am so poor a creature, I am so
devoid of moral strength, that the best part of my
soul is unconscious of what it does, and when
I attempt to act, I am defeated from the outset;
is it not true? Ah, there is never an hour of
noble and fruitful battle in my heart! Only an
utter ignorance of things, of feelings, a complete
surrender to the sweetness of love, and, thereby,
the loss of all peace, all hope!</p>

<p>"How you must despise me. You are just and
wise. You can't help despising a poor weak thing
like me, a woman whose heart is always open,
whose imagination is always ready to take fire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
whose changeable mind is never fixed, whose veins,
though cured of their great fever, are still burning, as
if her rebellious blood could do nothing but burn,
burn, burn. If you despise me&mdash;and your eyes,
your voice, your manner, all tell me that you do&mdash;you
are quite right. I never seem to be doing
wrong, yet I am always doing it; and then, when
I see it, it is too late to make good my error, to
recover my own happiness, or to restore that of
others. Ah, despise me, despise me; you are
right to despise me. I bend to every wind that
blows, like a broken reed. I am overturned and
rent by the tempest, for I know neither how to
defend myself nor how to die. Despise me; no
one can despise me as you can, no one has so good
a right to do it.</p>

<p>"When you are away from me, I can think of
you with a certain amount of courage, trusting to
your kindness, to your charity, to forgive me my
lack of strength. When you are away from me, I
feel myself more a woman, braver; I can dream
of being something to you, not an equal, no, but a
humble follower in the things of the soul. Dreams,
dreams! When you are with me, all my faith in
myself disappears; I recognise how feeble I am,
how extravagant, how incoherent; no more, never
more, can I hope for your indulgence.</p>

<p>"I think of my past&mdash;justly and cruelly you
reproached me with it&mdash;and I find in it such a
multitude of childish illusions, such an entirely
false standard of life and love, such a monstrous
abandonment of all right womanly traditions, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
my shame rushes in a flame to my face. Have you
not noticed it?</p>

<p>"Before that fatal day at Pompeii&mdash;the first day
of my real existence&mdash;I had a treasury of feelings,
of impressions, of ideas, my own personal ones,
by which my life was regulated, or rather by
which it was disturbed; they were swept away,
they were destroyed, they disappeared from my
soul on that day. To you, who showed me how
great my fault was, to you, who trampled down all
that I had cared for, I bow my head, I bow my
spirit. You were right. You are right. You only
are right. You are always right. I want to convince
you that I see the truth clearly now. Let
me walk behind you, let me follow you, as a servant
follows her master. Ah, give me a little strength
you who are strong, you who have never erred,
you who have conquered yourself and the world.
Give me strength, you who seem to me the model
of calmness and justice&mdash;above all hazards, because
you have known how to suffer in silence, above
all human joy, because you understand its emptiness;
and yet so kind, so indulgent, so quick to
forgive, because you are a man and never forget
to be a man.</p>

<p>"You despise me, that is certain; for all strong
natures must despise weakness. But it is also
certain that you pity me, because I am buffeted
about by the storms of life, without a compass,
without a star. I have already once been wrecked;
in that wreck I left behind me years of health and
hope, the best part of my youthful faith. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
now I am in danger of being wrecked again,
utterly and for ever, unless you save me.</p>

<p>"Say what you will to me; do what you will
with me. Insult me, after having despised
me. But don't leave me to my weakness, don't
withdraw your support from me. It is my only
help.</p>

<p>"What shall I call you? Friend?</p>

<p>"Friend, I shall be lost if you do not save me,
if you refuse to allow my soul to follow yours,
strengthened by your strength, if you cast me out
from your spiritual presence, if you do not give
me the support that my life finds in yours. Friend,
friend, friend, don't cast me off. Say what you
will, do what you will, but don't separate me from
you. If you do, I shall die. I, a beggar, knock
at your door."</p>

<p>The letter continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"You wounded me profoundly when you said
that it was perhaps Giustino Morelli, the man
for whose sake I refused to marry Luigi Caracciolo.
I can't hear the bare name of Morelli, without
shuddering with contempt. It isn't that I am
angry with him, no, no. It is that he does not
exist for me; he is the vain shadow of a dead
man. On the evening of "The Huguenots,"&mdash;ah
me! that music sings constantly in my soul, I shall
never forget it&mdash;he was there, and I didn't see
him, I wouldn't see him. I don't hate him. He
was a poor, weak fool; honest perhaps, for you
have said so; but small in heart and mind! And
thus my contempt for him is really contempt for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
myself, who made an idol of him. How was I
ever able to be so blind? When I think of it,
I wring my hands in desperation, for it was before
him that I burned the first pure incense of my
heart. I shall never forgive myself."</p>

<p>Cesare Dias read this letter twice through.
Then he left his house to go about his affairs and
his pleasures. Returning home, he read it for a
third time. Thereupon he wrote the following
note, which he immediately sent off.</p>

<p>"Dear Anna,&mdash;All that you say is very well; but
I don't know yet who the man is that you love.&mdash;Very
cordially, Cesare Dias."</p>

<p>She read it, and answered with one line: "I
love you.&mdash;Anna Acquaviva."</p>

<p>Cesare Dias waited a day before he replied:
"Dear Anna,&mdash;Very well. And what then?&mdash;Cesare
Dias."</p>

<p>In the exaltation of her passion she had taken
a step whereby she risked her entire future
happiness; and she knew it. She had taken the
humiliating step of declaring her love. Would
Dias hate her? She had expected an angry
letter from him, a letter saying that he would
never see her again; instead of which she had
received a colourless little note, neither warm nor
cold, treating her declaration as he might have
treated any most ordinary incident of his day.</p>

<p>That was the unkindest cut of all. Cesare Dias
was simply indifferent. For her, love was a
tragedy; for him, it was an ordinary incident of
his day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>What to do now? She could not think. What
to do? What to do? Had he himself not asked,
with light curiosity: "And what then?" He
had asked it with the sort of curiosity one might
show for the continuation of a novel one was
reading.</p>

<p>All night long she sobbed upon her pillow.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Laura, waking
up.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Go to sleep."</p>

<p>In the morning she wrote to him again:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me <em>what then</em>? I don't know;
I cannot answer. God has allowed me to love a
second time. I know nothing of 'then.' I only
know one thing&mdash;I love you. Perhaps you have
known it too, this long while. My eyes, my voice,
my words wherein my soul knelt before you, must
have told you that I loved you. Have you not
seen me bow my proud head daily in humility
before you? I began to love you that evening
when we came home together from Pompeii, when
my fever was beginning. Afterwards, my whole
nature was transformed by my love of you. I
don't ask you to love me. Perhaps you are bound
by other loves, past loves. Perhaps you have
never loved, and wish never to love. Perhaps I
don't please you, either spiritually or bodily. What
is passing in your mind? Who knows? I only
know that you are strong and wise, that you never
turn aside, that you follow your noble path tranquilly,
in the triumphant calm of your greatness.
Have you loved? Will you love? Who knows?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
All I ask is that you will let me love you, without
being separated from you. I ask that you will
promise to wish me well, not as your ward, not as
your sister, but as a poor girl who loves you with
all her soul and life. I don't ask you to change
your habits in any way; the least of your habits,
the least of your desires, is sacred to me. Live as
you have always lived, only remember that in a
corner of Naples there is a heart that finds its only
reason for existence in your existence, and continue
from time to time to give it a minute of your
presence. My love will be a silent companion to
you.</p>

<p>"Are you not the same man who said to me,
with a voice that trembled with pity, in that dark,
empty room at the inn in Pompeii, while I felt
that I was dying&mdash;are you not the same man
who said, <em>My poor child, my poor child</em>?</p>

<p>"You pitied me. You do pity me. You will
pity me. I know it, I know it. And that is the
'then' of my love.</p>

<p>"Don't write to me. I should be afraid to read
what you might write.</p>

<p>"Ah, how I love you! How I love you!</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Anna Acquaviva.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>Cesare Dias was very thoughtful after he had
read this letter. His vanity, the vanity of a man
of forty, was flattered by it. And Anna's love,
for the present, at any rate, seemed to be entirely
obedient and submissive. But would it remain
so? Cesare Dias had had a good deal of experience.
Anna's he knew to be a proud and self-willed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
character; would it always remain on its
knees, like this? Some day she would not be
content only to love, she would demand to be
loved in return.</p>

<p>He did not answer the letter. He was an
enemy to letter writing in general, to the
writing of love letters in particular; and, anyhow,
what could he say?</p>

<p>For two days he did not call upon her. On
the third day, he arrived as usual, at two o'clock.</p>

<p>Anna, during these days, had lived in a state of
miserable suspense and nervousness.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with her?" Stella Martini
asked of Laura.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>But the governess tormented her with questions,
and at last she answered impatiently: "I think
she is in love."</p>

<p>"Again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, again."</p>

<p>"And with whom?"</p>

<p>"She has never told me to tell you," cried
Laura, leaving the room.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" Stella asked
of Anna. "You are suffering. Why do you
conceal your sorrow from me?"</p>

<p>"If I am suffering, it's my own fault," said Anna.
"Only God can help me."</p>

<p>"Can't I help you? You are in deep grief."</p>

<p>"Deep grief."</p>

<p>"You have placed your hopes where they can't
be realised? Again?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Again."</p>

<p>"Why, dear? Explain it to me."</p>

<p>"Because it is my destiny, perhaps."</p>

<p>"You are young, beautiful, and rich. You
ought to be the mistress of your destiny. It is
only poor solitary people who have to submit to
destiny."</p>

<p>"I am poorer than the poorest beggar that
asks for alms in the street."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that," said Stella, gently,
taking her hand. "Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you about it, I can't. It is stronger
than I am," said Anna, and her anguish seemed to
suffocate her.</p>

<p>"Tell me nothing, then, darling. I understand.
I'm only a poor servant; but I love you so.
And I want to tell you, Anna, that there are no
sorrows that can't be outlived."</p>

<p>"If Heaven doesn't help me, my sorrow will
kill me."</p>

<p>"The only irremediable sorrow in this world is
the death of some one whom we love," said Stella,
shaking her head. "You will see."</p>

<p>"I would rather die than live like this."</p>

<p>"But is the case quite desperate? Is there no
ray of light?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Is it a man on whom your hope depends?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do I know him?"</p>

<p>But Anna put her fingers on her lips, to silence
Stella. The bell had rung. And, at the sound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of it, Stella heard a great sigh escape from Anna's
breast.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," said Anna, passing her
pocket-handkerchief over her face. "Go to the
drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Must I leave you alone?"</p>

<p>"I beg you to. I am so upset. I want a
minute of peace."</p>

<p>"And you will come afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I'll come when I can&mdash;when I am calm
again."</p>

<p>Stella went slowly away. In the drawing-room
she found Dias, who was showing a copy of
the illustrated <cite>Figaro</cite> to Laura. Dias bowed and
asked, "And Anna?"</p>

<p>"She will come presently."</p>

<p>"Is she well?"</p>

<p>"Not ill."</p>

<p>"Then she is not well?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. But you will see for yourself."</p>

<p>He and Laura returned to the engravings in
the <cite>Figaro</cite>, which were very good. Stella left
them.</p>

<p>Anna entered the room. Her heart was beating
wildly. She did not speak. She sat down
at the opposite side of the table on which the
newspaper was spread out.</p>

<p>Dias said, referring to the pictures, "They're
very clever."</p>

<p>"Very clever," agreed Laura.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Dias bowed to Anna, smiling, and asking, "How
do you do?"</p>

<p>"Well," she answered.</p>

<p>"Signora Martini told me that she feared you
were not very well."</p>

<p>"It's her affection for me, that imagines things.
I am quite well." In his tone she could feel
nothing more than pity for her. "I am only a
little nervous."</p>

<p>"It's the weather, the sirocco," said Dias.</p>

<p>"Yes, the sirocco," repeated Anna.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right when the sun shines," said he.</p>

<p>"When the sun shines, perhaps," she repeated
mechanically.</p>

<p>Laura rose, and left the room.</p>

<p>After a silence, Cesare Dias said, "It is true,
then, that you love me?"</p>

<p>Anna looked at him. She could not speak.
She made a gesture that said yes.</p>

<p>"I should like to know why," he remarked,
playing with his watch-chain.</p>

<p>She looked her surprise, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Yes, why," he went on. "You must have a
reason. There must be a reason if a woman loves
one man and not another. Tell me. Perhaps I
have virtues whose existence I have never suspected."</p>

<p>Anna, confused and pale, looked at him in
silence. He was laughing at her; and she
besought him with her gaze to have pity upon
her.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Anna. But you know it is my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bad habit not to take seriously things that appear
very serious to others. My raillery hurts you.
But some day you must really try to tell me why
you care for me."</p>

<p>"Because you are you," she said softly.</p>

<p>"That's a very profound reason," he answered
smiling. "But it would require many hours of
meditation to be understood. And, of course,
you will always love me?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>"May I say something that will pain you?"</p>

<p>"Say it," she sighed.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, then, that you are slightly
changeable. A year ago you thought you loved
another, and would love him always. Confess
that you have utterly forgotten him. And in
another year&mdash;what will my place be?"</p>

<p>But he checked himself. She had become livid,
and her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"I have pained you too much. Nothing gives
pain like the truth," he said. "But there,
smile a little. Don't you think smiles are as
interesting as tears? You're very lovely when
you smile."</p>

<p>And obediently she smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, then, this eternal love," he went on,
"what are we to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I only love you."</p>

<p>"Does that suffice?"</p>

<p>"I must make it suffice."</p>

<p>"You are easily satisfied. Will you always be
so modest in your hopes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"The future is in the hands of God," said she,
not having the courage to lie.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is what I want to talk about&mdash;the
future. You are hoping something from the future.
Otherwise you would not be satisfied. The future,
indeed! You are twenty. You have never thought
of my age, have you?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. For me you are young."</p>

<p>"And I will come to love you? That is your
hope?"</p>

<p>"I have asked for nothing. Don't humiliate me."</p>

<p>He bowed, slightly disconcerted.</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a
little portfolio in red leather, which he opened,
drawing forth two or three letters.</p>

<p>"I have brought your letters with me. Letters
are so easily lost, and other people read them.
So, having learned their contents, I return them
to you."</p>

<p>She did not take them.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, "aren't you glad to get them
back? But there's nothing women wish so much
as to get back the letters they have written."</p>

<p>"Tear them up&mdash;you," she murmured.</p>

<p>"It's not nice to tear up letters."</p>

<p>"Tear them, tear them."</p>

<p>"As you like," he said, tearing them up.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes while he was doing it.
Then she said with a sad smile:</p>

<p>"So, it is certain, you don't care for me?"</p>

<p>"I mustn't contradict you," he answered gallantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>He took her hand to bid her good-bye.</p>

<p>Slowly she went back to her bedroom.</p>

<p>There she found Stella Martini.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Stella, that day I left you
in the Church of Santa Chiara?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I remember."</p>

<p>"Well, now I tell you this&mdash;never forget it.
On that day I signed my own death-sentence."</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<p>The Villa Caterina was embowered amongst the
flowering orange-trees of Sorrento. On the side
towards the town the villa had a beautiful Italian
garden, where white statues gleamed amidst green
leaves, and where all day long one could listen
to the laughing waters of fountains. From the
garden a door led directly into a big drawing-room.
On the other side of the house a broad
terrace looked over the sea.</p>

<p>This was the summer home of the Acquaviva
family. It was bigger and handsomer than the
house in Naples. There was greater freedom,
greater luxury, greater cheerfulness here, than in
the gloomy palace of the Piazza dei Gerolomini.
The girls were very fond of Villa Caterina, and
their father, Francesco Acquaviva, had been very
fond of it. He had named it for his wife. It
was here that the couple had passed all the
summers of their married life; it was here that
Caterina Acquaviva had died. The girls had a
sweet, far-away memory of their mother; in her
room at the Villa she was almost like a living
presence to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>When the spring came Anna began to speak
of going to Sorrento. She felt that if she could
get away from Naples she might experience a
change of soul. The broad light and ceaseless
murmur of the sea would calm her and strengthen
her. When Laura or Stella asked her, "What is
the matter?" she would answer, "I don't like
being <em>here</em>."</p>

<p>She said nothing of her great sorrow. She
shut it into her heart, and felt that it was killing
her by inches. She passed long hours in silent
meditation, her eyes fixed vaguely upon the air;
when spoken to, she would start nervously, and
look at her interlocutor as if she had suddenly been
called back from a distant land of dreams.</p>

<p>Those who loved her saw her moral and
physical trouble. She stayed in the house day
after day; she gave up her walks; she went no
more to the theatre. She had lost her interest
in the things that used to please her. She was
very gentle, very kind to everybody. To Cesare
Dias she showed an unfailing tenderness. She
was often silent before him. When he spoke to
her, she would reply with a look, a look of such
deep melancholy that even his hard heart was
touched. She was very different to the impetuous
creature of former times.</p>

<p>When the spring came, with its languorous
warmth, her weakness increased. In spite of all
her efforts to conquer her desire to do so, she
would spend long hours writing to Cesare. It
was her only way of showing the love that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
consuming her. It was a great comfort, and, at
the same time, a great pain. She wrote at great
length, confusedly, with the disorder and the
monotony of a spirit in distress; and as she wrote
she would repeat her written phrases aloud, as if
he were present, and could respond. She wrote
thrilling with passion, and her cheeks burned.
But, after she had committed her letters to the
post, she would wish them back, they seemed so
cold, so absurd, so grotesque, and she cursed the
moment in which she had put pen to paper.</p>

<p>Cesare Dias never answered her. How could
she expect him to, indeed? Had he not torn her
first letters up, under her eyes?</p>

<p>Whenever his servant brought him one of
Anna's letters he received it with a movement of
impatience. He was not altogether displeased,
however. He read them with a calm judicial
mind, amused at their "rhetoric," and forbore to
answer them. He went less frequently to her
house than formerly. They were rarely alone
together now. But sometimes it happened that
they were; and then, observing her pale face, her
eyes red from weeping, he asked: "What is it?
Why do you go on like this?"</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do?" she returned.</p>

<p>"I want you to be merry, to laugh."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that is impossible," she said, drooping
her eyes to hide the tears in them.</p>

<p>And Dias, fearing a scene, was silent.</p>

<p>He was a man of much self-control, but he
confessed to himself that he would not be able,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as she was, to bear an unrequited love with
patience.</p>

<p>Anna was a woman, a woman in the full sense
of the word. She had hoped to win his heart;
but now she relinquished hope. And one day, in
May, she wrote him a letter of farewell; she would
never write again; it was useless, useless. She bade
him farewell; she said she would like to go away,
go away from Naples to Sorrento, to the Villa
Caterina, where her mother had loved and died.</p>

<p>She begged Laura and Stella to take her to
Sorrento. And Stella wrote to Dias to ask his
permission. He replied at once, saying he thought
the change of air would be capital for Anna.
They had best leave at once. He could not call
to bid them good-bye, but he would soon come to
see his dear girls at the Villa.</p>

<p>Stella said: "Dias has written to me."</p>

<p>"When?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Yesterday. He says he can't come to bid us
good-bye, he's too busy."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;too busy. Will you give me the
letter?"</p>

<p>"It's a very kind letter," said Stella. She saw
that Anna's hand was trembling as it held the
white paper. Anna did not return it.</p>

<p>"Dias is very kind," said Anna.</p>

<p>They left Naples on the last day of May.</p>

<p>When they reached the villa, the two girls went
directly to their mother's room. Laura opened the
two windows that looked out upon the sea and let
in the sunlight, and she moved from corner to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
corner, taking note of the dust on the furniture.
Anna knelt at the praying-desk, above which hung
a cross, an image of the Virgin, and a miniature of
her mother.</p>

<p>Laura asked:</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay here?"</p>

<p>Anna did not answer.</p>

<p>"When you come away bring me the key," said
the wise Minerva, and went off, softly closing the
door behind her.</p>

<p>"Where is Anna?" asked Stella.</p>

<p>"She is still up there," said Laura.</p>

<p>"What is she doing?"</p>

<p>"Weeping, or praying, or thinking. I don't
know."</p>

<p>"Poor Anna," sighed Stella.</p>

<p>How long did Anna remain on her knees before
the image of the Virgin and the portrait of her
mother? No one disturbed her. She kept murmuring:
"Oh, Holy Virgin! Oh, my mother!"
alternately.</p>

<p>When she came away, having closed the windows
and locked the door, she was so pale that
Stella said:</p>

<p>"You have stayed up there too long. It has
done you harm."</p>

<p>"No, no," Anna answered; "I am very well;
I am so much better. I am glad we have come
here. I should like to live here always."</p>

<p>But Stella was not reassured. And at night the
thought of her pupil troubled her and would not
let her sleep. Sometimes she would get up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
go to the door of Anna's room. There was always
a light burning within. Two or three times she
had entered; Anna lay motionless on her bed,
with her eyes closed. Then Stella had put out the
light.</p>

<p>"Why do you leave your light burning at night?"
she asked Anna one day.</p>

<p>"Because I am afraid of the dark."</p>

<p>Thereupon Stella had prepared a little lamp for
her, with a shade of opalescent crystal that softened
its light; and almost every night Stella
would go to Anna's room to see whether she was
asleep. Her pale face in the green rays of the
lamp had the semblance of a wreck slumbering at
the bottom of the sea. Sometimes, hearing Stella's
footsteps, Anna opened her eyes and smiled upon
her; then relapsed into her stupor. For it was
not sleep; it was a sort of bodily and mental
torpor that kept her motionless and speechless.
Stella returned to her own room, in no wise reassured.
And what most worried this good woman
was the long visit which Anna made every day to
the room of her dead mother.</p>

<p>The villa was delightful during these first weeks
of the summer, with its fragrant garden, its big,
airy, cheerful, luxurious apartments, its splendid
view of the sea. In the cool and perfumed mornings,
in the evenings that palpitated with starlight,
every window and balcony had its special fascination.
But Anna saw and felt nothing of all this;
her mother's room alone attracted her. There she
passed long hours kneeling beside the bed, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
seated at a window, silent, gazing off at the sea,
with a white expressionless face. Sometimes Stella
came to the door and called:</p>

<p>"Anna&mdash;Anna!"</p>

<p>"Here I am," she answered, starting out of her
reverie.</p>

<p>"Come away; it is late."</p>

<p>"I am coming."</p>

<p>But she did not move; it was necessary to call
her again and again.</p>

<p>Her stations there exhausted her. She would
return from them with dark circles under her eyes,
her lips colourless, the line of her profile sharpened
and accentuated.</p>

<p>Stella felt a great pity for her, a great longing
to be of help to her. She tried to persuade her
to cut short her vigils in her mother's room.</p>

<p>"You ought not to stay so long. It is bad for
you."</p>

<p>"No, no," Anna answered. "If you knew the
peace I find there."</p>

<p>"But a young girl like you ought to wish for
the excitements of life, not the peace."</p>

<p>"There are no more flowers for Margaret,"
quoted Anna, going to the window and looking
towards the sea.</p>

<p>During the whole month of June, a lovely
month at Sorrento, where the mornings are warm
and the evenings fresh, Anna fell away visibly
in health and spirits. Laura and Stella did not
interfere with her, but it saddened them to witness
her decline. Stella's anxiety was almost motherly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
When she saw Anna's pale, peaked face, when she
noticed her transparent hands, a voice from within
called to her that she must do something for the
poor girl.</p>

<p>One day she said, "Signor Dias has promised
to come here for a visit. But he's delaying a little.
Perhaps he'll come for the bathing season."</p>

<p>"You will see. He'll not come at all," replied
Anna, her eyes suddenly filling with tears.</p>

<p>"He's so kind, and he has promised. He will
come."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," Anna answered sadly.</p>

<p>Indeed, he neither came nor wrote. The first
fortnight of July had passed; the bathing season
had already begun. Sorrento was full of people.
In the evening, till late into the night, from every
window, from every balcony, and from the big
brilliantly lighted drawing-rooms of the hotels,
came the sounds of singing and dancing, the
tinkling of mandolines, the laughter of women&mdash;a
gay, passionate, summer music. The villas were
protected from the sun by blue and white striped
awnings, which fluttered in the afternoon breeze
like the sails of ships. At night the moon bathed
houses, country, and sea in a radiance dazzling as
snow. Anna, in the midst of all this merriment,
this health and beauty, felt only the more profoundly
a great longing to end her life. It was
seldom now that she so much as moved from one
room to another. In the evening, when Stella and
Laura would go out to call upon their friends,
Anna would seat herself in an easy-chair on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
terrace of the Villa, and fix her eyes upon the sky,
where the Milky Way trembled in light. And on
the sea beyond her, people were singing in boats,
or sending up fireworks from yachts. Round
about her sounded the thousand voices of the
glorious summer night, voices of joy, voices of
passion. Anna neither saw nor heard.</p>

<p>But in Stella's face she could not help noticing
an expression of sympathy which seemed to say,
"I have divined&mdash;I have guessed." And in the
kiss which Stella gave her, before going out, on
the evening of the 17th of July, Anna felt an even
deeper affection than usual. Laura and Stella
were going to a dance at the Villa Victoria.</p>

<p>"Be strong and you will be happy," Stella said,
and her kiss seemed meant as a promise of good
news.</p>

<p>But the poor child did not understand. She
took Stella's words as one of those vague efforts
at consolation which people make for those who
are inconsolable, and shook her head, smiling
sadly. Lovely in her white frock, Laura too came
and kissed her. And then she heard the carriage
drive away. Anna left the drawing-room and
went out upon the terrace. There was a full
moon; its light was so brilliant one might have
read by it. There was something divinely
beautiful in the view&mdash;from the horizon to the
arch of the sky, from the hills behind her, covered
with olives and oranges, to the sea before her.
And she felt all the more intensely the sorrow of
her broken life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>She lay back in her easy-chair, with her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said Cesare Dias.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, but she could not speak.
She could only look at him, and she did so with
such an expression of desolate joy that he told
himself: "This woman really loves me."</p>

<p>He appeared to be very thoughtful. He drew
up a chair, and sat down next to her.</p>

<p>"Are you surprised to see me, Anna? Didn't
I promise to come?"</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;that you had forgotten. It is so
easy to forget."</p>

<p>"I always keep my promise," he declared.</p>

<p>When had she heard him speak like this before,
with this voice, this inflexion&mdash;when? Ah, she
remembered: when she was ill, when they thought
she was going to die. So it was pity for one
threatened with death that had brought him to
Sorrento; it was pity that banished its habitual
irony from his voice.</p>

<p>"The air of Sorrento hasn't cured you," he
said, bending a little to look at her.</p>

<p>"It hasn't cured me. It has cured me of
nothing. I think I shall never be cured. There
is no country in the world that can cure me."</p>

<p>"There is only one doctor who can do you any
good&mdash;that doctor is yourself."</p>

<p>He opened his silver cigarette-case, took out a
cigarette, and lit it.</p>

<p>She watched the vacillating flame of his match,
and for a moment did not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is easy to say that," she went on finally,
with a feeble voice. "But you know I am a weak
creature. That is why you have so much compassion
for me. I shall never be cured, Cesare."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I am sure. I have tried. My love has
proved itself stronger than I. It is destroying
me. My heart can no longer endure it."</p>

<p>He looked off into the clear air of the night,
watching the spiral of his cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>"And all those beautiful spiritual promises," he
said, "that wonderful structure of abnegation, of
sacrifice, of unrequited love, has come to nothing!
Those plans for the future, which you conceived
in such lofty unselfishness, have failed?"</p>

<p>"Failed, failed," she exclaimed, with a sigh,
gazing up at the starry sky, as if to reproach it
with her own unhappiness. "All that I wrote to
you was absurd, a passing illusion. All my plans
were based upon absurdities. Perhaps there are
people in the world who are so perfectly made
that they can be contented to love and not be
loved in return; they are fortunate, they are
noble; they live only for others; they are purity
incarnate. But I am a miserable, selfish woman,
nothing else; I have expected too much; and I
am dying of my selfishness, of my pride."</p>

<p>She raised herself in her chair, grasping its
arms nervously with her hands, and shaking her
beautiful head, wasted by grief.</p>

<p>He was silent. He threw away his cigarette,
which had gone out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The soft moonlight covered all things.</p>

<p>"I am so earthly," she went on. "I have
prayed for a better nature, for an angelic heart,
raised above all human desires, that I might
simply love you, and wish for nothing else. I
have exhausted myself with prayers and tears,
trying thus to forget that you could not care for
me. I have forbidden myself the great comfort
of writing to you. I left Naples, and came here,
far from you&mdash;from you who were, who are my
light, my life. In vain, I have passed whole days
here, praying to my mother and to the Madonna
to free me from these terrible, heavy, earthly
chains that bind me to that longing to be loved,
and that are killing me. No use, no use! My
prayers have not been answered. I have come
away from them with a greater ardour, a more
intense longing, than ever. I am a woman. I
am a woman who doesn't know how to lift herself
above womanly things, who, womanlike, longs to
be loved, and who will never, never be consoled
for the love she cannot have."</p>

<p>After a long pause, he asked, "And what do
you wish me to do, Anna?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done. All is ended;
all is over. Or, rather, nothing has ever been
begun."</p>

<p>"Anna, I assure you, it grieves me to see you
suffer."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But what can you do for me?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
It is all due to my own folly. I admit that I am
unbalanced, extravagant. I know it. I am paying
dearly for my folly; ah, the expiation is hard.
It is all due to my one mistake, my one fault.
Everybody is very kind to me, more than kind.
But I have sinned, and I must expiate my sin."</p>

<p>"But how is it all to end?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Do you know what the simplest solution
would be?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"My death. Ah, to rest! to rest for ever,
under the earth, in a dark grave!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that. People don't die of love."</p>

<p>"Yes that is true. There is indeed no
recognised disease called <em>love</em>. Neither ancient
nor modern doctors are acquainted with it; they
have never discovered it in making their autopsies.
But love is such a subtle deceiver! It is at the
bottom of all mortal illnesses. It is at the bottom
of those wasting declines from which people suffer
for years, people who have loved too much, who
have not been loved enough. It is in those
maladies of the heart, where the heart bursts with
emotion or dries up with despair. It is in those
long anæmias which destroy the body fibre by
fibre, sapping its energies. It is in that nervousness
which makes people shiver with cold and
burn with insupportable heat. Oh, no one dies
suddenly of love. We die slowly, slowly, of
troubles that have so many names, but are really
all just this&mdash;that we can endure to love no longer,
and that we are not loved. Who will ever know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the right name of the illness from which I shall
die? The doctor will write a scientific word on
paper, to account for my death to you, to Laura,
to Stella. But you know, you at least, that I
shall die because you do not love me."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Anna."</p>

<p>"I am calm. I have no longer the shadow of
a hope. But I am calm, believe me. I have to
tell you these things because they well up from
my soul of their own accord. I am an absolutely
desperate woman, but I am calm, I shall always
be calm. Don't answer me. Everything that you
can say I have already said to myself. All is
ended. Why should I not be calm?"</p>

<p>"But, if you no longer hope for anything, then
you have hoped for something. For what?" he
asked, with a certain curiosity.</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens!" she cried. "That you should
ask me that!"</p>

<p>"Tell me, Anna. You see that I ask it with
sympathy, with lively sympathy."</p>

<p>"But you must have forgotten what love is like,
if you ask me to tell you what its hopes are," she
exclaimed. "One hopes for everything when one
loves. From the moment when I first trembled
at the sound of your voice, from the moment when
first the touch of your hand on mine thrilled me
with delight, from the moment when first the words
you spoke, whether they were hard or kind, scornful
or friendly, seemed to engrave themselves upon
my spirit, from the moment when I first realised
that I was yours&mdash;yours for life, from that moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I have hoped that you might love me. From
that moment it has been my dream that you might
love me, with a love equal to my own, with a self-surrender
equal to my own, with an absolute concentration
of all your heart and soul, as I love you.
That has been the sublime hope that my love has
cherished."</p>

<p>"It was an illusion," he said softly, looking off
upon the broad shining sea, bathed in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I know it. Why do you remind me of it?
Why are we talking of it? My soul had fallen
into a torpor. But now you rouse me from it.
My heart throbs as if you had reopened its wound.
Don't tell me again that you don't care for me. I
know it, I know it."</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, why do you torment yourself
like this?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I have known it a long while now.
My great hope died little by little, day by day, as
I saw how unlike me you were, how far from me;
as I understood your contempt for me, your pity;
as I realised that there were secrets in your life
which I could not know; as I perceived that the
differences of our ages and tastes had bred differences
of feeling. In a hundred ways, voluntarily
and involuntarily, you showed me that love did
not exist for you, either that you would never
love, or, at any rate, that you would never love
me. I read my sentence written in letters of
flame on my horizon. And yet, you see, in spite
of the blows that fate had overwhelmed me with,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
I was not resigned. I told myself that a young
and ardent woman could not thus miserably lose
herself and her love. I thought that there was a
way of saving herself which ought to be tried, a
humble way, but one that I could pursue in
patience. Shall I tell you my other dream?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me."</p>

<p>"Well, I dreamed that you would let me unite
my weak and stormy youth to your warm and
serene maturity, in such a manner as to complete
more profoundly and more intimately the work of
protection that Francesco Acquaviva had confided
to you at his death. You saved me at Pompeii.
That seemed to sanction a supreme act of devotion
on my part. My dream was simple and modest.
I would love you with all my strength, but in
silence; I would live with you, loving and following
you like a fond shadow. Every hour, every
minute, I would be able to offer you unspoken,
but eloquent proofs of my love. I would be your
satellite, circling round you, drinking in the light
of my sun. I would watch my chance to do for
you, to serve you, to make you happy. And in
this way, never asking for gratitude, asking for
nothing, I would spend my life, to its last day,
blessing you, worshipping you, for your kindness
in letting me be near you, in letting me love you.
Ah, what a vision! It would be worthy of me,
to make such a sacrifice of every personal desire;
and worthy of you to lift a poor girl up to the
happiness of seeing you every day, of sharing
your home and your name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would like me to marry you?" asked
Dias.</p>

<p>"Your wife, your mistress, your friend, your
servant&mdash;whatever you wish will suffice for me.
To be where you are, to live my life out near
to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am old," he said, coldly, bitterly.</p>

<p>"I am young, but I am dying, Cesare."</p>

<p>"Old age is a sad thing, Anna. It freezes
one's blood and one's heart."</p>

<p>"What does it matter? I don't ask you to
love me. I only want to love you."</p>

<p>"Will you never ask it of me?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Promise."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"By whatever you hold most sacred, will you
promise it?"</p>

<p>"By Heaven that hears me, by the blessed souls
of my mother and father who watch over me; by my
affection for my sister Laura; by the holiest thing
in my heart, that is, by my love for you, I promise
it, I swear it, I will never ask you to love me."</p>

<p>"You won't complain of me, and of my coldness?"</p>

<p>"I will never complain. I will regard you as
my greatest benefactor."</p>

<p>"You will let me live as I like?"</p>

<p>"You will be the master. You shall dispose
of your life and of mine."</p>

<p>"You will let me go and come, come and go,
without finding fault, without recriminations?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you go out I will await in patience the
happy hour of your return."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. There was another
question on his mind, and he hesitated to ask it.
But with burning eyes, with hands clasped imploringly,
she waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>"You won't torment me with jealousy?" he
asked at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens!" she cried, stretching out her
arms and beating her brow with her hands; "must
I endure that also?"</p>

<p>"As you wish," he said, coldly. "I see that I
displease and offend you. I am making demands
that are beyond your strength. Well, let us drop
the subject."</p>

<p>And he rose as if to go away. She moved
towards him and took his hand.</p>

<p>"No, no; don't leave me. For pity's sake stay
a little longer. Let us talk&mdash;listen to me. You
ask me not to be jealous; I'll not be jealous. At
least, you'll not see my jealousy. Do you wish
me to visit the woman you're in love with, or
have been in love with, or the woman who's in
love with you? Do you wish me to receive the
women who are your friends? I'll do it&mdash;I'll do
everything. Put me to the most dreadful trial&mdash;I'll
endure it. Ask me to go to the furthest
pass a soul and body can reach&mdash;I'll do it for you."</p>

<p>"I wish to be free, heart-free, that is all," he
said, firmly.</p>

<p>"As you are to-day, so you will always be&mdash;free
in heart," she responded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen to me, Anna, and understand me clearly.
For a moment try to escape from your own personality,
forget that you are you, and that you love
me. For a moment consider calmly and carefully
the present and the future. Anna, I am old, and
you are young; and the discrepancy of our ages
which now seems trifling to you, in ten years' time
will seem terrible, for I can only decline, while you
will grow to maturity. In your imagination you
have conceived an ideal of me which doesn't correspond
to the truth, and which the future will
certainly correct, to your sorrow. Between our
characters and our temperaments there is a profound
gulf; we have no reason to believe that the
future can close it up. If I am making a sacrifice,
as I confess I am, in speaking to you thus, it is
certain that you would make a more painful and
a more lasting one in living with me. Think of
it, think of it. Think of my age, of your illusions
which must inevitably be destroyed, of our mutual
sacrifice. Anna, there is still time."</p>

<p>She looked at him, surprised to hear him speak
in this earnest way, the man who was accustomed
to dominate all his own emotions. He was really
moved; his brow was knitted; and on it, for the
first time, Anna could read a secret distress.
There was something almost like shyness in his
eyes; he seemed less distant, less strong perhaps,
than he had ever seemed to her before, but more
human, more like other people, who suffer and
weep.</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna," he went on, "put aside all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
selfishness, and be yourself the judge. Judge
whether I ought to consent to what you wish. I
have told you cruelly, brutally, what I shall expect
from you in return from my sacrifice. I have
repeated to you again and again what a grave
step it is that you propose. Now, my dear child
be calm, and judge for yourself."</p>

<p>She was leaning with her two hands on the
parapet of the terrace, and kept her eyes cast down.</p>

<p>"But why," she asked slowly, in a low voice,
"why are you willing&mdash;you who are so wise, so
cold, who despise all passion, as you do&mdash;why are
you willing to make this sacrifice? Who has
persuaded you? Who has won you?"</p>

<p>"I am willing because you have told me that
there is no other way of saving you; because
Stella Martini has written to me saying that I
ought to save you; because I myself feel that I
ought to save you."</p>

<p>"It is for pity then that you are willing to do
this thing?"</p>

<p>"You have said it," he replied, not wishing to
repeat the unkind word.</p>

<p>"God bless you for your pity," she said humbly,
crossing her hands as in prayer.</p>

<p>There was a deep silence. He stood with his
head bowed, thinking, and waiting for her to
speak. She was looking at the sky as if she
wished to read there the word of her destiny.
But in her heart and in her mind, from the sky,
and from the glorious landscape, only one word
could she, would she, hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Anna, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask? I love you, and without
you I should die. Anything is better than death.
You are my life."</p>

<p>"Then you will be my wife and my friend," he
said resolutely.</p>

<p>"Thank you, love," and she knelt before him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he had gone away, she bent down and
kissed devotedly the wall of the terrace, where he
had leaned, speaking to her.</p>

<p>And then she went to each of the big vases
that stood in a row along the terrace, and picked
all the flowers that grew in them, the roses, the
geraniums, the jasmine-buds, and pressed them
to her bosom in a mass, because they had listened
to her talk with him. And before re-entering the
house, she looked again, with brilliant eyes full of
happiness, upon the sea and the sky and the wide
moonlit landscape.</p>

<p>Within the house every one was asleep. The
servant who was sitting up for Laura and Stella
nodded in the anti-chamber. Anna was quite alone,
and her heart danced for joy.</p>

<p>Silently she passed through the house, and entered
her mother's room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mamma, Mamma, it is you who have done
this," she said.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<p>Anna wore a pink dressing-gown of soft wool,
with a low-cut sailor's collar and monk's-sleeves,
so that her throat and wrists, round and pale with
the warm pallor of ivory, were left uncovered.
Her hair was drawn up in a rich mass on the top
of her head, and confined by two or three pins of
yellow tortoise-shell. Her black eyes were radiant
with youth and love.</p>

<p>She opened the door of her room.</p>

<p>She had a little clock in a case of blue velvet
lightly ornamented with silver; Cesare had given
it to her during their honeymoon, and she always
kept it by her. She looked at this, and saw that
it was already eleven. The April sunshine poured
merrily into the room, brightening the light colours
of the upholsteries, touching with fire her bronze
jewel-case, her hanging lamp of ancient Venetian
wrought iron, and the silver frame of her looking-glass,
and giving life to the blue forget-me-nots on
the white ground of her carpet.</p>

<p>It was eleven. And from the other end of the
apartment (where, with Stella Martini she occupied
two or three rooms) Laura had sent to ask at what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hour they were to start for the Campo di Marte.
Anna had told the servant to answer that they
would start soon after noon, and that she was
getting ready.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood still in the middle of
her room, undecided whether or not to move in
the direction that her feet seemed inclined to take
of their own will&mdash;pretty little feet, in black slippers
embroidered with pearls.</p>

<p>Then she opened the door.</p>

<p>A short passage separated her room from her
husband's. Her husband's room had a second
door, letting into a small hall, whence he could
leave the house without Anna's knowing it, without
her hearing so much as a footstep.</p>

<p>She crossed the passage slowly, and leaned
against the door, not to listen, but as if she lacked
courage to knock. At last, very softly, she gave
two quick raps with her knuckles.</p>

<p>There was a minute of silence.</p>

<p>She would never have dared to knock a second
time, already penitent for having ventured to disturb
her lord and master.</p>

<p>A cold quiet voice from within inquired, "Who
is it?"</p>

<p>"It's I, Cesare," she said, bending down, as if
to send the words through the keyhole.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, please."</p>

<p>Patiently, with her bejewelled hand on the knob,
and the train of her pink dressing-gown heaped
about her feet, she waited. He never allowed her
to come in at once, when she knocked at his door,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he seemed to take a pleasure in prolonging and
subduing her impatience.</p>

<p>Presently he opened the door. He was already
dressed for the Campo di Marte, in the appropriate
costume of a lover of horse-racing.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear lady," he said, bowing with that
fine gallantry which he always showed to women,
"aren't you dressed yet?"</p>

<p>And as he spoke he looked at her with admiring
eyes. She was so young and fresh, and living,
with her beautiful round throat, her flower-like
arms issuing from her wide monk's sleeves, and
her tiny feet in their black slippers, that he took
her hand, drew her to him, and kissed her on the
lips. A single kiss; but her eyes lightened softly,
and her red lips remained parted.</p>

<p>He stretched himself in an easy-chair, near
his writing-desk, and puffed a cigarette. All the
solid and simple yet elegant furniture of the
big room which he occupied, was impregnated
with that odour of tobacco, which solitary
smokers create round themselves like an atmosphere.</p>

<p>Anna sat down, balancing herself on the arm of
a chair covered with Spanish leather. One of her
feet played with the train of her gown. She
looked about, marvelling as she always did, at the
vast room a little bleak with its olive plush, its
arms, its bookcase, its handful of books in brown
bindings, and here and there a bit of carved ivory
or a bright-coloured neck-tie, and everywhere the
smell of cigarette-smoke. His bed was long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
narrow, with a head-piece of carved wood; its
coverlet of old brocade fell to the floor in folds,
and mixed itself with the antique Smyrna carpets
that Cesare Dias had brought home from a journey
in the East. Attached to the brown head-piece
there was a big ivory crucifix, a specimen of Cinquecento
sculpture, yellow with age. The whole
room had a certain severe appearance, as if here
the gallant man of the world gave himself to
solitary and austere reflections, while his conscience
took the upper hand and reminded him of the
seriousness of life.</p>

<p>The big drawers of his writing desk surely contained
many deep and strange secrets. Anna had
often looked at them with burning, eager eyes, the
eyes of one anxious to penetrate the essence of
things; but she had never approached them, fearing
their mysteries. Only, every day, after breakfast,
when her husband was away, she had put a
bunch of fresh, fragrant flowers in a vase of Satsuma,
whose yellow surface was crossed by threads
of gold, and placed them on the dark old desk,
which thereby gained a quality of youth and
poetry. He treated the flowers with characteristic
indifference. Now and then he would wear one
of them in his button-hole; oftener he seemed unconscious
of their existence. For a week at a
time jonquils would follow violets and roses would
take the place of mignonette in the Satsuma vase,
but Cesare would not deign to give them a look.
This morning, though, he had a tea-rose bud in his
button-hole, a slightly faded one that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
plucked from the accustomed nosegay; and Anna
smiled at seeing it there.</p>

<p>"At what time are we going to the races?" she
asked, remembering the business that had brought
her to his room.</p>

<p>"In about an hour," he answered, looking up
from a memorandum-book in which he was setting
down certain figures with a pencil.</p>

<p>"You are coming with us, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And yet&mdash;we shall look like a Noah's
ark. Perhaps I'd better go with Giulio on the
four-in-hand."</p>

<p>"No, no; come with us. When we are there
you can go where you like."</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said, making another entry in
his note-book.</p>

<p>She looked at him with shining eyes; but he
continued his calculations, and paid her no attention.
Only presently he asked:</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to dress?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she answered softly.</p>

<p>And slowly she went away.</p>

<p>While her maid was helping her to put on her
English costume of nut-coloured wool, she was
wondering whether her husband would like it; she
never dared to ask him what his tastes were in
such matters; she tried to divine them. Before
dressing, she secured round her throat by a chain
an antique silver reliquary, which enclosed, however,
instead of the relics of a saint, the only love
letters that he had ever written to her, two little
notes that had given her unspeakable pain when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
she had received them. And as she moved about
her room at her toilet, she cast repeated glances at
his portrait, which hung over her writing-table.
Round her right arm she wore six little golden
bracelets with pearls suspended from them; and
graven upon each bracelet was one letter of his
name, Cesare. Her right hand gleamed with many
rings set with precious stones; but on her left
hand her wedding-ring shone alone.</p>

<p>When she had adjusted her veil over her English
felt hat, trimmed with swallows' wings, she
looked at herself in the glass, and hesitated. She
was afraid she wouldn't please him; her dress was
too simple; it was an ordinary morning street
costume.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and Laura appeared.
As usual, she wore white, a frock of soft white
wool, exquisitely delicate and graceful. Her hat
was covered with white feathers, that waved with
every breath of air. And in her hands she held a
bunch of beautiful fresh tea-roses.</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty you are!" cried Anna. "And
who gave you those lovely roses?"</p>

<p>"Cesare."</p>

<p>"Give me one&mdash;give me one." And she put
out her hand.</p>

<p>She put it into her button-hole, inexpressibly
happy to possess a flower that he had brought to
the house and presented to her sister.</p>

<p>"When did you see Cesare?" she asked, taking
up her purse, across which <em>Anna Dias</em> was stamped,
and her sunshade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't seen him. He sent these flowers to
my room."</p>

<p>"How kind he is."</p>

<p>"Very kind," repeated her sister, like an echo.</p>

<p>They went into the drawing-room and waited
for Cesare. He came presently, drawing on his
gloves. He was somewhat annoyed at having to
go to the races with his family&mdash;he who had
hitherto always gone as a bachelor, on a friend's
four-in-hand, or alone in his own phæton. His bad
humour was only partially concealed.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is the charming Minerva!" he cried,
perceiving Laura. "How smart we are! A
proper spring toilet, indeed. Good, good! Well,
let's be off."</p>

<p>Anna had hoped for a word from him too, but
she got none. Cesare had seen her dress of nut-coloured
wool, and he deemed it unworthy of
remark. For a moment all the beauty of the
April day was extinguished, and she descended
the stairs with heavy steps. But out of doors the
air was full of light and gaiety; the streets were
crowded with carriages and with pedestrians; on
every balcony there were ladies in light colours,
with red parasols; and a million scintillating
atoms danced in every ray of sunshine. Anna
told herself she must bear in patience the consequences
of the error she had made in putting on
that ugly brown frock. Laura's face was lovely as
a rose under her white hat; and Anna rejoiced in
her sister's beauty, and in the admiring glances
that everybody gave her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's going to be beastly hot," said Cesare, as
they drove into the Toledo, where a crowd had
gathered to watch the procession of carriages.</p>

<p>"The Grand Stand will be covered. We'll find
a good place," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm to leave you when we get there," he
reminded her. He was determined to put an end
to this family scene as soon as he could. "I must
leave a clear field for Laura's adorers. I give
place to them because I am old."</p>

<p>Laura smiled.</p>

<p>"So, Anna, I'll leave you to your maternal
duties. I recommend you to keep an especial
eye upon Luigi Caracciolo&mdash;upon him in particular."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Anna asked absently.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear."</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;&mdash;" she began, without finishing
her sentence.</p>

<p>Bows and smiles and words of greeting were
reaching them from every side. They passed or
overtook numberless people whom they knew,
some in carriages, some on foot. Cesare was
inwardly mortified by the conjugal exhibition of
himself that he was obliged to make, and looked
with secret envy at his bachelor friends.</p>

<p>But his regret was sharpest when a handsome
four-in-hand dashed past, with Giulio Carafa on
the box and the Contessa d'Alemagna beside
him. That dark, vivacious, blue-eyed lady wore
a costume of pale yellow silk, and a broad straw
hat trimmed with cream-coloured feathers. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
carried a bunch of lilac in her hands, lilac that
lives but a single day in our ardent climate, and
is rich with intoxicating fragrance. All the men
on Carafa's coach bowed to Dias, and the Contessa
d'Alemagna smiled upon him and waved her
flowers; and his heart was bitten by a great desire
to be there, with them, instead of here, in this stupid
domestic party.</p>

<p>He was silent; and Anna's eyes filled with
tears, for she understood what his silence meant.
At the sight of her tears his irritation increased.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" he asked, looking at her
with his dominating coldness.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said, turning her head away, to
hide her emotion.</p>

<p>That question and answer were equivalent to one
of the long and stormy discussions that are usual
between husbands and wives. Between them such
discussions never took place. Their life was regulated
according to the compact they had made on
that moonlit night at Sorrento; she realised now
that what had then seemed to her a way of being
saved was only a way of dying more slowly; but
he had kept his word, and she must keep hers.
He had married her; she must not reproach him.
Only sometimes her sorrow appeared too plainly;
then he never failed to find a word or a glance to
remind her of her promise.</p>

<p>To-day, for the thousandth time, he regretted the
sacrifice he had made, and cursed his generosity.</p>

<p>The whole distance from the Toledo to the
Campo di Marte was passed in silence. As they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
approached the Reclusorio, Luigi Caracciolo drove
by them with his tandem. He bowed cordially to
them. Anna dropped her eyes; Laura smiled
upon him.</p>

<p>"What a handsome fellow!" exclaimed Dias,
with the sincere admiration of one man of the
world for another.</p>

<p>"Very handsome," said Laura, who was accustomed
to speak her girlish mind with sufficient
freedom.</p>

<p>"He pleases you, eh?" inquired Cesare, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"He pleases me," she said, with her habitual
freedom and her habitual indifference.</p>

<p>"It's a pity he was never able to take Anna's
fancy," Cesare added, with enigmatical irony.</p>

<p>"I hate handsome youths," said Anna, proudly.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be the impetuous woman that
you are, my dear, if you didn't hate everything
that other people like. We've got a creature of
passion in the family, Laura," he said, with a frank
expression of scorn.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the cruel sister.</p>

<p>Anna smiled faintly in disdain. Again the
beauty of the day was extinguished for her; the
warm April afternoon was like a dark winter's
evening.</p>

<p>The rose that Laura had given her had fallen
to pieces, shedding its petals on the carriage floor.
Anna would have liked to gather them all up and
preserve them. The most she could do, however,
was to take a single one that lay in her lap, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
put it into the opening of her glove, against the
palm of her hand.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the racing-grounds they
met the Contessa d'Alemagna again. She smiled
graciously upon Anna and Laura. Anna tried to
smile in return; Laura bowed coldly.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the Contessa d'Alemagna?"
asked Cesare, as he conducted his wife and sister-in-law
to their places in the members' stand.</p>

<p>"No," said Laura.</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said he.</p>

<p>"That may be. But she's antipathetic to me."</p>

<p>"I like her," said Anna, feebly.</p>

<p>Cesare found places for them, and gave them
each an opera-glass. Then he stood up and said
to Anna:</p>

<p>"You will be all right here?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Nothing I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I'll come back for the third race. I'm going
now to bet. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And he went off with the light step of a liberated
man. Anna watched him as he crossed the turf
towards the weighing-stand.</p>

<p>She was surrounded by acquaintances, and they
were all talking together. Being a bride, she
received a good deal of attention; Dias was
popular, and his popularity reflected itself upon
her. Besides, people found her interesting, with
her black, passionate eyes, the pure oval of her
face, and her fresh red lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo came up to where the sisters
were seated.</p>

<p>"Cesare has deserted you?" he asked, jestingly.</p>

<p>"He's gone to bet. He'll soon come back,"
said Anna.</p>

<p>"He's betting with the Contessa d'Alemagna,"
suggested Laura, with one of those perverse smiles
which contrasted so oddly with the purity of her
face.</p>

<p>"Then he'll not come back so soon," said Luigi,
sitting down.</p>

<p>"Have you never seen the races before?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, I have never seen them," said Anna.</p>

<p>"It's rather a tiresome sight," said he, pulling his
blonde moustaches.</p>

<p>"It's interesting to see the people," said Anna.</p>

<p>"It's the crowd that always gives its interest to
a scene," said he, with an intonation of profound
thought.</p>

<p>Laura was looking through her opera-glass.
"There's Cesare," she cried suddenly.</p>

<p>Cesare was walking and talking with the
beautiful Contessa d'Alemagna, and two other
men, who walked in front of them, occasionally
turned and took part in the conversation. As he
passed his wife and sister, he looked up and
bowed. Anna responded, smiling, but her smile
was a forced and weary one.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo, feigning not to have noticed
this incident, said to her: "That's a charming
dress you're wearing. It's an inspiration."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you like it?" she asked, with a thankful
look.</p>

<p>"Yes. I admire these English fashions. I
think our women are wrong to go to a horse-race
dressed as if for a garden-party. It's not
smart."</p>

<p>He took her sunshade and toyed with it,
reading the inscription, engraved on its silver
handle.</p>

<p>"'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Attendre pour atteindre.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Is that your motto?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you never had another?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"It's a wise one," he remarked. "It's a fact
that everything comes at last to those who know
how to wait."</p>

<p>"Alas! not everything, not everything," she
murmured, sadly.</p>

<p>There was a burst of applause from the multitude.
The second race was over, and the favourite
had won, a Naples-bred horse. People crowded
about the bookmakers, to receive the value of
their bets.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Cesare has won," said Laura. "He
was always talking about <cite>Amarilli</cite>."</p>

<p>"Cesare always wins," said Luigi.</p>

<p>"He is not named Cesare<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> for nothing," said
Anna, proudly.</p>

<p>"And like the great Julius all his victories were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
won after he had turned forty&mdash;especially those in
Germany."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>But Anna did not hear this malicious pleasantry.
She was thinking of other things.</p>

<p>By and by her husband came to her.</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying it, Anna?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am enjoying it."</p>

<p>"And you, Laura?"</p>

<p>"Oh, immensely," she answered, coldly.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the weighing ground?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, taking her shawl and her sunshade.</p>

<p>"I can't take <em>you</em>," said Cesare to his wife, who
was gazing imploringly at him. "We should look
ridiculous."</p>

<p>But she did not appear resigned.</p>

<p>"We should be ridiculous," he repeated imperiously.
"Thank goodness, we're not perpetually
on our wedding journey."</p>

<p>They went away, leaving her with a pain in
her heart which she felt was killing her. She
half closed her eyes, and only one idea was clear
in the sorrowful confusion of her mind&mdash;that her
husband was right. She had broken their agreement;
she had promised never to entreat him,
never to reproach him. It was weak and wicked
of her, she told herself, to have consented to such
an agreement&mdash;a compact by which her love,
her pride, and her dignity were alike bound to
suffer. She had made another great mistake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
when she did that, and this time an irreparable
mistake.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are alone?" said Luigi Caracciolo,
coming up again.</p>

<p>"Alone."</p>

<p>"Something is troubling you. What is it?"</p>

<p>"I am bored; and a person who is bored bores
others."</p>

<p>"Let us bore ourselves together, Signora Dias.
That will be diverting. I have always wished to
bore myself with you, you know."</p>

<p>She shook her head, to forbid his referring to
the past.</p>

<p>"Ah, you won't consent? You're very cruel."</p>

<p>She put her opera-glass to her eyes, and looked
off across the course.</p>

<p>"If you're going to treat me as badly as this,
you'd better send me away," he said, with some
feeling.</p>

<p>"The stand is free to all the world," she
answered, tormented by the thought that if her
husband should come back, he might imagine that
she was glad to talk with Caracciolo.</p>

<p>"You are a Domitian in woman's clothes," he
cried. "Ah, you women! When you don't like
a man you destroy him straightway."</p>

<p>She did not hear him; or, hearing, she did not
understand.</p>

<p>"You are too high up for me," he went on.
"To descend to my level would be impossible for
you and unworthy of you. It's equally impossible
for me to rise to yours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken. I'm anything rather
than a superior being. I'm a human earthly
woman, like all others&mdash;more than others."</p>

<p>"Then why do you suffer?"</p>

<p>"Because love is very bitter."</p>

<p>"What love?"</p>

<p>"All love. It is bitterer than aloes, bitterer
than gall, bitter in life and in death."</p>

<p>There was another outburst of applause, and the
crowd began to move. The races of the first day
were over.</p>

<p>Anna looked for her husband. He appeared
presently, with Laura on his arm.</p>

<p>"You leave your wife to the most melancholy
solitude," said Caracciolo, laughing.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would keep her company,
you're such a true friend to me," laughed
Cesare.</p>

<p>Caracciolo gave his arm to Anna.</p>

<p>"In any case, it wasn't to render you a service,"
said Luigi.</p>

<p>"I know your fidelity," said Dias.</p>

<p>"You are my master."</p>

<p>Neither of the ladies spoke. Anna gave herself
up to the happiness of having recovered her
husband, of going away with him, of taking him
home. He seemed excited and pleased, as if he
had enjoyed the events of the afternoon without
stopping to analyse their frivolity and emptiness.
He had amused himself in his usual way, forgetting
for the moment the subtle but constant annoyance
of his marriage. He was merry, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
showed his merriment by joking with Caracciolo,
with Laura, even with his wife.</p>

<p>Anna was very happy. The long day had tired
her. But now she felt the warmth and comfort of
his presence, and that compensated her for her
hours of abandonment. They had some difficulty
finding their carriage, but Cesare was not impatient.
Caracciolo, meanwhile, was looking for
his own tranquilly, never for a moment neglecting
his chivalric duties.</p>

<p>When their carriage was discovered, the two
men helped the ladies into it; and Cesare, standing
beside it, disposed of their shawls and their
opera-glasses with the carefulness of a model
husband, at the same time exchanging a passing
word or two with Caracciolo.</p>

<p>Suddenly Cesare closed the carriage-door, and
said to the coachman&mdash;"Home."</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with us?" Anna asked in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"No. There's a place for me on Giulio Carafa's
four-in-hand. I shall get to Naples sooner than
you will. The four-in-hand can go outside the
line."</p>

<p>"Four-in-hands are very amusing," said Caracciolo,
shaking hands with the two women.</p>

<p>"Shall we have a late dinner?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Don't wait dinner for me. I am going to dine
at the Contessa d'Alemagna's, with Giulio Carafa
and Marco Paliano."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Anna.</p>

<p>She watched Cesare and Luigi as they moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
away, puffing their cigarettes. Then she said to
the coachman, "Drive home."</p>

<p>During the long drive the sisters scarcely spoke.
They were accustomed to respect each other's hours
of silence. A soft breeze was blowing from the
north. They were both a little pale. Perhaps it
was the spectacle of the return from the Campo di
Marte, which made them thoughtful; the many
carriages, full of people who bore on their faces
the signs of happiness due to a fine day of sunshine,
passed in the open air, amid the thousand
flattering coquetries of love and fancy; the
beautiful women, wrapped in their cloaks; the
sort of spiritual intoxication that glowed in the
eyes of everybody.</p>

<p>The streets were lined by an immense crowd of
shop-keepers and working-people, who made a
holiday pleasure of watching the stream of
carriages; and another crowd looked down from
the balconies of the houses.</p>

<p>Presently Anna leaned forward and took her
shawl and wrapped it round her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?" asked Laura, helping her.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Laura also put on her shawl; she, too, was
cold.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo's tandem passed them. Anna
did not see him. Laura bowed.</p>

<p>When they had reached the Piazza San Ferdinando,
Anna asked: "Would you like to drive
about a little?"</p>

<p>"No, let us go home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>And when they were in the house, "We must
go in to dinner," Laura said.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to dine. I have a headache,"
said Anna.</p>

<p>At last she was alone. In her own room she
threw aside her hat and veil, her sunshade, her
purse, her pocket-handkerchief; she fell into an
arm-chair, and was shaken by a storm of sobs and
tears.</p>

<p>From above her little writing-table Cesare's
portrait seemed to smile upon the flowers that
were placed under it.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, and looked at his beautiful
and noble face, which appeared to glow with love
and life. A great impulse of passion rose in her
heart; she took the portrait and kissed it, and
bathed it in her tears, murmuring, "my love, my
love, why do you treat me like this? Ah, I can
only love you, love you; and you are killing me."</p>

<p>Hours passed unnoticed by her. Some one came
to her door and asked whether she wished for a
lamp; she answered, "No."</p>

<p>By-and-bye she saw a white figure standing
before her. She recognised Laura. And she
saw that Laura was weeping. She had never
seen her weep before.</p>

<p>"You are crying. What are you crying for?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Laura, vaguely, with a gesture.</p>

<p>And they wept together.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>Cesare Dias came home one day towards six
o'clock, in great good humour. At dinner he
found everything excellent, though it was his
habit to find everything bad. He ate with a
hearty appetite, and told countless amusing
stories, of the sort that he reserved for his agreeable
moments. He joked with Laura, and with
Anna; he even complimented his wife upon her
dress, a new one that she had to-day put on for
the first time. He succeeded in communicating
his gaiety to the two women. Anna looked at
him with meek and tender eyes; and as often as
he smiled she smiled too.</p>

<p>Laura, it is true, spoke little, but in her face
shone that expression of vivacity, of animation,
which had characterised it for some time past.
She agreed with everything Cesare said, bowing
her head.</p>

<p>After dinner they all passed into Anna's drawing-room.
It was her evening at home; and
noticing that there were flowers in all the vases&mdash;it
was in June, just a year after their talk at
Sorrento&mdash;and seeing the silver samovar on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
table, Cesare asked: "Are you expecting people
to-night, Anna?"</p>

<p>"A few. Perhaps no one will come."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's why you've got yourself up so
smartly."</p>

<p>"Did you fancy it was for you, that she had put
on her new frock, Cesare?" Laura asked, jestingly.</p>

<p>"I was presumptuous enough to do so; and
all presumptions are delusions. I'll bet that Luigi
Caracciolo is coming&mdash;the ever faithful one."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said Anna, indifferently.</p>

<p>"Oh, you hypocrite, Anna!" laughed Laura.</p>

<p>"Hypocrite, hypocrite!" repeated Cesare, also
laughing. "Come, I'll warrant that the obstinate
fidelity of Caracciolo has at last made an impression.
Admirable! He's been in love with
you for a hundred years."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cesare, don't joke about such subjects,"
Anna begged, in pain.</p>

<p>"You see, Laura, she is troubled."</p>

<p>"She's troubled, it's true," affirmed Laura.</p>

<p>"You're both of you heartless," Anna murmured.</p>

<p>Cesare opened his cigarette case, and playfully
offered a cigarette to each of the ladies.</p>

<p>"I don't smoke," said Laura.</p>

<p>"Why don't you learn to?"</p>

<p>"Smoke is bad for the teeth;" and she showed
her own, shining like those of Beatrice in the tale
by Edgar Poe.</p>

<p>"You're right, fair Minerva. Will you smoke,
Anna?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't smoke, either," she said, with a soft
smile.</p>

<p>"You ought to learn. It would be becoming
to you. You're dark, you have the Spanish type,
and a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">papelito</i><a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> would complete your charm."</p>

<p>"I will learn, Cesare," she assented.</p>

<p>"And what's more, smoke calms the nerves.
You can't imagine the soothing effect it has.
Nothing is better to relieve our little sorrows."</p>

<p>"Give me a cigarette, then," she said at once.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have little sorrows?"</p>

<p>"Who knows!" she sighed, putting aside her
cigarette.</p>

<p>"You have no little sorrows, Laura?" asked
Cesare.</p>

<p>"Neither little ones nor big ones."</p>

<p>"Who can boast of having never wept?" said
Anna, with a melancholy accent.</p>

<p>"If we become sentimental, I shall take myself
off," said Cesare.</p>

<p>"No, no, don't go away," Anna prayed him.</p>

<p>"I would remind you that we've got to pass our
whole life-time together," said he, ironically, knocking
off the ash of his cigarette.</p>

<p>"All our life-time, and more beyond it," said
Anna, pensively.</p>

<p>"And more beyond! It's a grave affair. I
will think of it while I am dressing, this evening."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To take a walk," he answered, rising.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why don't you stay here?" she ventured
to ask.</p>

<p>"I can't. I'm obliged to go out."</p>

<p>"Come home early, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Early&mdash;yes," he consented, after a short
hesitation.</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you, Cesare."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Good-night."</p>

<p>He went off.</p>

<p>Laura, according to her recent habit, had
listened to this dialogue with her eyes half
closed, and biting her lips; she said nothing.
Whenever her sister and her brother-in-law exchanged
a few affectionate words (and, indeed,
Cesare did no more than respond to the affection
of Anna), she assumed the countenance of a
statue, which neither feels nor hears nor sees; or
else, she got up and left the room noiselessly.
Often Anna surprised on Laura's face a cynical
smile that appeared the antithesis of its extreme
purity, the irony of an icy virgin who is aware of
the falsity and hollowness of love.</p>

<p>This evening, when Cesare had left them, the
sisters remained together for a few minutes. But
apparently both their minds were absorbed in deep
thought; at any rate they could not keep up a
conversation. Anna, in her lilac-coloured frock,
lay in an easy-chair, leaning her head on her
hands, over which her black hair seemed like a
warrior's helmet. Laura was pulling and playing
with the fringe of her white dress.</p>

<p>"I'm going; good night," she said suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you go, Laura?" asked Anna, issuing
from her reverie.</p>

<p>"There's no use staying. People will be arriving."</p>

<p>"But stay for that very reason. You will help
me to endure their visits."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a task above my strength," said the
blonde and beautiful Minerva. "Then, anyhow,
it's you they come to see, my dear."</p>

<p>"You'll be married some day yourself," said
Anna, laughing.</p>

<p>She was still in a pleasant mood&mdash;a reflection
of Cesare's gaiety; and then he had promised to
come home early.</p>

<p>"Who knows! Good night," and Laura rose
to go away.</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Read a little; then sleep."</p>

<p>"What are you reading?"</p>

<p>"'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le mot de l'énigme</i>,'<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> by Madame Pauline
Craven."</p>

<p>"A mystical romance? Do you want to become
a nun?"</p>

<p>"Who knows! Good night."</p>

<p>Anna herself took up a book after Laura's
departure. It was <cite>Adolphe</cite>, by Benjamin Constant;
she had found it one day on her
husband's writing-desk. In its cool yet ardent
pages one feels the charm of a truthful story,
surging up from the heart in a single, vibrant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cry of pain. Anna had read it two or three times;
now she began it again, absent-mindedly. But
she did not read long. A few callers came; the
Marchesa Scibilia, her relative, accompanied by
Gaetano Althan, who always liked to go about with
old ladies; Commander Gabriele Mari, a man of
seventy; and then the Prince of Gioiosa, a handsome,
witty, and intelligent Calabrian.</p>

<p>The conversation, of course, was a mixture of
frivolity and seriousness, as conversations are apt
to be in a small gathering like the present, where
nobody cares to appear too much in earnest, and
everybody tries to speak in paradoxes.</p>

<p>The Prince di Gioiosa was the last to leave; it
was then past eleven.</p>

<p>"No one else will come," she thought.</p>

<p>But she was mistaken. Acquaintances passing
in the street, and seeing her windows alight, came
up to pay their respects. When the last of these
had gone, "It is late; no one else will come," she
thought again.</p>

<p>But again she was mistaken. The servant
announced Luigi Caracciolo; and the handsome
young fellow entered, with that English correctness
of bearing which somewhat tempered the
vivacity of his blonde youthfulness. He was in
evening dress, and wore a spray of lilies of the
valley in his button-hole.</p>

<p>Anna gave him her hand amicably. Her rings
glittered in the lamplight.</p>

<p>"Starry hand," he said, bowing, and pressing it
softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" she asked, with
that polite curiosity which implies no real interest.</p>

<p>"From the opera," he said, seating himself
beside her.</p>

<p>"What were they giving?"</p>

<p>"'The Huguenots'&mdash;always the same."</p>

<p>"It is always beautiful."</p>

<p>"Do you remember?" he asked with a tender,
caressing voice. "They were singing 'The Huguenots'
on the evening when I was introduced to
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I remember that evening," she said,
with sudden melancholy.</p>

<p>"How horribly I displeased you that night,
didn't I? The only thing to approach it was the
tremendously delightful impression you made on
me."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" she protested kindly.</p>

<p>"And your first impression of me has never
changed&mdash;confess it," he said.</p>

<p>"Even if that were true, it wouldn't make you
very unhappy."</p>

<p>"What can you know about that? You beautiful
women, admired and loved&mdash;what do you
know?"</p>

<p>"You're right. Indeed, we know nothing."</p>

<p>But he saw that her mind was away in a land
of dreams, far from him. He felt all at once the
distance that divided them.</p>

<p>"When you come back from your travels let me
know, that I may welcome you," he said, with his
smooth, caressing voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"What travels?"</p>

<p>"Ah! If I knew! If I knew where your
thoughts are wandering while I talk to you, I
could go with you, I could follow you in your
fantasies. Instead, I speak, and you don't listen
to me. I say serious things to you in a jesting
tone, and you understand neither the seriousness
nor the joke. You leave me here alone, whilst you
roam&mdash;who knows where? And I, a humble
mortal, without visions, without imagination, I can
only wait for your return, my dear lady."</p>

<p>If, indeed, there was a certain poetic quality in
what he said, there was a deeper poetry still in
the tenderness and sweetness of his voice. He sat
in front of her, gazing into her face, as if he could
not tear himself from that contemplation. She
sometimes lowered her eyes, sometimes turned
them away, sometimes fixed them upon a page
of <cite>Adolphe</cite>, which she had kept in her hands. If
his gaze embarrassed her, however, his soft voice
seemed to calm her nerves. She listened to it,
scarcely understanding his words, as one listens to
a vague pleasant music.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it bore you to wait?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am never bored here. When I have this
lovely sight before my eyes."</p>

<p>"What sight?" she inquired, ingenuously.</p>

<p>"Your person, my dear lady."</p>

<p>"But you can't always be looking at me," she
said, laughing, trying to turn the conversation to a
jest.</p>

<p>"That's a fatal misfortune, as they say in novels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
I should like to pass my whole life near to you.
Instead, I'm obliged to pass it among a lot of
people who are utterly indifferent to me. A great
misfortune!"</p>

<p>"It's not your fault," she said, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"It certainly isn't. But that doesn't console
me. Shall we try it&mdash;passing our lives together?
One can overcome misfortunes. Our whole lives&mdash;that
will mean many years."</p>

<p>"But I am married," she said, feeling that the
talk was becoming dangerous.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," he cried emphatically.</p>

<p>"Caracciolo, I believe you've found the means
to see me no more. What do you want from me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear lady, nothing," he answered,
with genuine grief in his face and voice.</p>

<p>"Then you ought not to risk destroying one of
your friendships. What would Cesare have said
if he had heard you for the last half hour?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. He couldn't have heard me,
you know, because he's never here."</p>

<p>"Sometimes he is," she said, with sudden emotion.</p>

<p>"Never, never. Don't tell pious fibs."</p>

<p>"He's always here."</p>

<p>"In your heart. I know it. It's an agreeable
home for him, the more so because he can find
others of the same sort wherever he goes."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"One of my usual vulgarities. I'm speaking
ill of your husband."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then be quiet."</p>

<p>But to soften the severity of this command, she
offered him a box of cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Thanks for your charity," he said.</p>

<p>And he began to smoke, looking at one of her
slippers of lilac satin embroidered with silver,
which escaped from beneath her train. She sat
with her elbow on the table, thinking. It was
midnight. In a few minutes Caracciolo would
be gone; and Cesare couldn't delay much longer
about coming home.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo seemed to divine her thoughts.</p>

<p>"After this cigarette, I will leave you. I'm
afraid I've given you no great idea of my wit."</p>

<p>"I detest witty men."</p>

<p>"Small harm! I hope you believe, though,
that I have a heart."</p>

<p>"I believe it."</p>

<p>"All the better. One day or another you will
remember what I have said to you this evening,
and understand it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, vaguely.</p>

<p>"You had a very happy inspiration, to dress in
lilac. It's such a tender colour. That's the tint
one sees in the sunsets at Venice. Have you
ever been at Venice?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"That's a pity. It's a place full of soft tears.
One can make a provision of them there, to last a
life-time. Trifling loves become deep at Venice,
and deep loves become indestructible. Good-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, like a white flower
issuing from the satin of her sleeve. He touched
it lightly with his lips, and went away.</p>

<p>Not for a moment during her conversation with
Luigi Caracciolo had her husband been absent
from Anna's mind. And all that the young man
said, which constantly implied if it did not directly
mention love, had but intensified her one eternal
thought.</p>

<p>It was now half-past twelve. She rose and
rang the bell; and her maid appeared.</p>

<p>They left the drawing-room and went into
Anna's bedroom, which was lighted by a big
lamp with a shade of pink silk.</p>

<p>Her maid helped her to undress, thinking that
she was going to bed; but presently Anna asked
for her tea-gown of cream-coloured crape, and put
it on, as if she meant to sit up. She had loosened
her hair, and it fell down her back in a single rich
black tress.</p>

<p>The maid asked if she might go to bed. Anna
said, "Yes." Cesare had given orders that no
servant should ever sit up for him; he had a
curiously wrought little key, a master-key, which
he wore on his watch-chain, and which opened
every door in his house. Thus he could come in
at any hour of the night he liked, without being
seen or heard. The maid went softly away,
closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Anna sat down in an easy chair, beside her
bed. She still had the volume of <cite>Adolphe</cite> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
her hand. She sat still there, while she heard
the servant moving about the apartment, shutting
the windows. Then all was silent.</p>

<p>Anna got up, and opened the doors between
her room and her husband's. So she would be
able to hear him when he returned. He could
not delay much longer. He had promised her to
come home early; he knew that she would wait
for him. And, as she had been doing through
the whole evening, but with greater intensity than
ever, she longed for the presence of her loved one.
Was not every thing empty and colourless when
he was away? And this evening he had been
so merry and so kind. His promise resounded in
her soul like a solemn vow. She thrilled with
tremulous emotion. The softness of the spring
night entered into her and exhilarated her.</p>

<p>She lay back in her easy-chair, with closed
eyes, and dreamed of his coming. She felt an
immense need of him, to have him there beside
her, to hold his hand in hers, to lean her head
upon his shoulder in sweet, deep peace, listening
to the beating of his heart, supported by his arms,
while his breath fell upon her hair, her eyelids,
her lips. A dream of love; vivid and languid,
full of delicate ardour and melancholy desire.</p>

<p>She surprised herself murmuring his name.
"Cesare, Cesare," she said, trembling with love at
the sound of her own voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to her that she heard a
noise in her husband's room. Then he had
come!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftly, like a flying shadow, she crossed the
passage, and looked in. Only silence and darkness!
She had been mistaken. She leaned on
the frame of the door, and remained thus for a
long moment.</p>

<p>Slowly she returned to her own room, thinking
that "early" must mean for a man of late habits
like Cesare two o'clock in the morning. That
was it! He would arrive at two.</p>

<p>She took up <cite>Adolphe</cite>, thinking to divert herself
with reading, and thus to moderate her
impatience. She opened the book towards the
middle, where the passionate struggle between
Ellenore and Adolphe is shown in all its sorrowful
intensity. And from the dry, precise words,
the hard, effective style, the brief and austere
narrative, which was like the cry of a soul destroyed
by scepticism, Anna derived an impression of
fright. Ah, in her sincere, youthful faith, what a
horror she had of that modern malady which
corrupts the mind, depraves the conscience, and
kills whatever is most noble in the soul! What
could she know, poor, simple, ignorant woman,
whose only belief, whose only law, whose only
hope was love&mdash;what could she know of the
spiritual diseases of those who have seen too
much, who have loved too much, who have
squandered the purest treasures of their feelings?
What could she know of the desolating torture of
those souls who can no longer believe in anything,
not even in themselves, and who have lost their
last ideal? She could know nothing; and yet a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
terror assailed her. Perhaps Cesare, her husband,
was like <cite>Adolphe</cite>, who could never more be
happy, who could never more give happiness to
others. She shuddered, and threw the book aside,
in great distress.</p>

<p>She got up mechanically, and took from a table
a rosary of sandal wood, which a Missionary
Friar had brought from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>She had never been regular in her devotions;
her imagination was too fervid. But religious
feelings seemed sometimes to sweep in upon her
in great waves of divine love. A child of the
South, she only prayed when moved by some
strong pain, for which she could find no earthly
relief. She forgot to pray when she was happy.
Now she pressed her rosary to her lips, and began
to repeat the long and poetical Litany, which
Domenico de Guzman has dedicated to the Virgin.
Ingenuously enough, she thought that in this way
the time would pass more rapidly, two o'clock
would strike, and Cesare would arrive. But she
endeavoured in vain to fix her mind upon her
orisons; it flew away, before her, to her meeting
with her Beloved; and though her lips pronounced
the words of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater</i>, their sense
escaped her. Once or twice she paused for a few
minutes, and then went on, confused, beseeching
Heaven's pardon for her slight attention.</p>

<p>When her rosary was finished, it was two
precisely. Now Cesare would come.</p>

<p>She could not control her nervousness. She
took her lamp and went into her husband's room:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
she placed the lamp on the writing-desk, and
seated herself in one of the leather arm-chairs.
She felt easier here; the austerity of the big
chamber, with its dark furniture, told her that her
husband's soul was above the sterile and frivolous
pleasures in which he had already lost the best
part of the night.</p>

<p>The air still smelt of cigarette smoke. Here
and there a point of metal gleamed in the lamplight.
On a table lay a pair of gloves; they had
been worn that day, and they retained the form of
his hands. She kissed them, and put them into
the bosom of her gown.</p>

<p>But where was Cesare?</p>

<p>She began to pace backwards and forwards,
the train of her dress following her like a white
wave. Why did he not come home? It was late,
very late. There were no balls on for that night;
no social function could detain him till this hour.</p>

<p>Where was Cesare? Ah, Cesare, Cesare, Cesare,
her dear love, where was he? She passed her hands
over her burning forehead.</p>

<p>All at once, looking out into the night, she
noticed in the distance the windows of Cesare's
club, brilliantly lighted. Then a sudden peace
came to her. He would be there, playing, talking,
enjoying the company of his friends, forgetful
of the time. It was an old habit of his, and old
habits are so hard to break. She remained at
the window of his room, with her eyes fixed upon
the windows of his club; the light that shone
from them was the pole-star of her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>She opened the window and went out upon the
balcony.</p>

<p>Presently two men issued from the club-house,
stood for a moment chatting together at the
entrance, and then moved off towards the Chiaia.
Ah, she thought, the company at the Club was
beginning to break up; at last Cesare would
come. At the end of ten minutes, four men came
out together. These also chatted together for a
minute, then separated, two going towards the
Riviera, two entering the Via Vittoria. By-and-by
one man came out alone, and advanced directly
towards Dias' house. This, this surely would
be he.</p>

<p>The man was looking up, towards the balcony.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Signora Anna," said the voice of
Luigi Caracciolo.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she murmured, faint with disappointment.</p>

<p>Caracciolo had stopped, and was leaning on the
railing, gazing up at her. Anna drew back out of
sight.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Anna," he repeated, very softly.</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>Caracciolo went off, slowly, slowly; stopping
now and then to look back.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes again upon the windows of
the club, but they were quite dark; the lights had
been extinguished.</p>

<p>So Caracciolo had been the last to leave; and
Cesare was not there!</p>

<p>She felt terribly cold, all at once. Her teeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
chattered. She went back into the room, shivering,
and had scarcely strength enough to shut the
window. She fell upon a chair, exhausted. The
clock struck. It was half-past three.</p>

<p>And now a hideous suspicion began to torture
her. There were no balls to-night, no receptions,
no functions. The club was shut up. The cafés
were shut up. All talking, eating, drinking,
gambling, were over for the night. The life of
the night was spent. Everybody had gone home
to bed. Then where was Cesare? Cesare, her
husband, was with a woman! And jealousy
began to gnaw her heart. With a woman; that
was certain. The truth burned her soul. He
could be nowhere else than with a woman.
The truth rang in her heart like a trumpet-blast.
Mechanically she put her fingers to her ears to
shut out the words&mdash;<em>with a woman, with a
woman</em>.</p>

<p>But what woman?</p>

<p>She knew nothing of her husband's secrets,
nothing of his past or present loves.</p>

<p>She was a mere stranger whom he tolerated,
not a friend, not a confidant. She was a troublesome
bond upon him, an obstacle to his pleasures,
an interference with his habits. No doubt there
were older bonds, stronger ties, that kept him from
her; or it might be the mere force of a passing
fancy. But for what woman, for what woman?
In vain she tried to give the woman a name, a
living form.</p>

<p>Oh, certainly not a lady, not a woman of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
honourable rank and reputation; not the Contessa
d'Alemagna.</p>

<p>Who then? Who then?</p>

<p>How much time passed, while she sat there, in
a convulsion of tears and sobs, prey to all the
anguish of jealousy?</p>

<p>The day broke; a greenish, livid light entered
the room.</p>

<p>The handle of the door turned. Cesare came
in. He was very pale, with dull, weary eyes.
He had a cigarette in his mouth; his lips were
blue. The collar of his overcoat was turned up;
his hands were in his pockets. He looked at
his wife indifferently, coldly, as if he did not
recognise her.</p>

<p>She rose. Her face was ashen. Her capacity
for feeling was exhausted.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>He threw away his cigarette, and took off his
hat. How old and used up he looked, with his
hair in disorder, his cheeks sunken from lack of
sleep.</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you," she said.</p>

<p>"All night?"</p>

<p>"All night."</p>

<p>"You have great patience."</p>

<p>He opened the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Anna."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Cesare."</p>

<p>And she returned to her own room.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>About the middle of June, in the first summer of
his marriage, Cesare Dias brought his wife and his
sister-in-law to the Villa Caterina at Sorrento.
He would leave them there, while he went to take
the baths at Vichy. Afterwards he was going to
Saint-Moritz in the Engadine, whither betake
themselves such persons as desire to be cold in
summer, the same who, desiring to be hot in
winter, hibernate at Nice. Anna had secretly
wished to accompany her husband upon this journey,
longing to be alone with him, far from their usual
surroundings; but she was to be left behind.</p>

<p>Ever since that night when she had sat up till
dawn waiting for him, tormented, disillusioned,
her faith destroyed, her moral strength exhausted,
there had been a coldness between the couple.
Cesare had lost no time in asserting his independence
of her, and had vouchsafed but the vaguest
explanations, saying in general terms that a man
might pass a night out of his house, chatting with
friends or playing cards, for any one of a multitude
of reasons. Anna had listened without
answering. She dreaded above all things having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a quarrel with her husband. She closed her eyes
and listened. He flung his explanation at her
with an air of contempt. She was silent but not
satisfied.</p>

<p>She could never forget the hours of that night,
when, for the first time, she had drained her cup
of bitterness to its dregs, and looked into the
bottom depths of human wickedness. The sweetness
of her love had then been poisoned.</p>

<p>As for Cesare, he had been exceedingly annoyed
by her waiting for him, which seemed to him an
altogether extravagant manifestation of her fondness.
It annoyed him to have been surprised in
the early morning light looking old and ugly; it
annoyed him to have to explain his absence; and
it annoyed him finally to think that similar scenes
might occur again. Oh, how he loathed these
tragic women and their tragedies! After having
hated them his whole life long, them and their
tears and their vapourings, behold! he had been
trapped into marrying one of them&mdash;for his sins;
and his rancour at the inconceivable folly he had
committed vented itself upon Anna. She, sad in
the essence of her soul, humble, disheartened,
understood her husband's feelings; and by means
of her devotion and tenderness sought to procure
his pardon for her offence&mdash;the offence of having
waited for him that night! One day, when Anna
had been even more penitent and more affectionate
than usual, he had indeed made some show of
forgiving her, with the pretentious indulgence of a
superior being; she had taken his forgiveness as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
slave takes a kind word after a beating, smiling
with tears in her eyes, happy that he had not
punished her more heavily for her fault.</p>

<p>But the truth is, he was a man and not an
angel. He had forgiven her; yet he still wished
to punish her. On no consideration would he take
her with him to Vichy and Saint-Moritz. He gave
her to understand that their wedding-journey was
finished; that it would never do to leave her sister
Laura alone for two months with no other chaperone
than Stella Martini; that it wasn't his wish
to play Joseph Prudhomme, and travel in the bosom
of his family; in short, he gave her to understand
in a thousand ways that he wished to go alone;
and she resigned herself to staying behind in preference
to forcing her company upon him. She
flattered herself, poor thing, that this act of submission,
so hard for her to make, would restore
her to her lord's good graces. He went away,
indeed in great good temper. He seemed rejuvenated.
The idea of the absolute liberty he
was about to enjoy filled him with enthusiasm.
He recommended his ladies (as he jokingly called
the sisters) not to be too nun-like, but to go out,
to receive, to amuse themselves as they wished.
Anna heard this advice, pale with downcast eyes;
Laura listened to it with an odd smile on her lips,
looking straight into her brother-in-law's face.
She too was pale and mute.</p>

<p>After his departure a great, sad silence seemed
to invade the villa. Each of the sisters was pensive
and reserved; they spoke but little together;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
they even appeared to avoid each other. For the
rest, the charming youthful serenity of the blonde
Minerva had vanished; her white brow was
clouded with thought. They were in the same
house, but for some time they rarely met.</p>

<p>Anna wrote to Cesare twice a day; she told
him everything that happened; she opened to him
her every fancy, her every dream; she wrote with
the effusiveness of a passionate woman, who, too
timid to express herself by spoken words, finds her
outlet in letters. Writing, she could tell him how
she loved him, that she was his in body and soul.
Cesare wrote to her once or twice a week, and not
at length; but in each of his notes there would
be, if not a word of love, at least some kindly
phrase; and upon that Anna would live for three
or four days&mdash;until his next letter arrived. He
was enjoying himself; he was feeling better; he
would return soon. Sometimes he even expressed
a wish for her presence, that she might share his
pleasure in a landscape or laugh with him at some
original fellow-traveller. He always sent his
remembrances to Laura; and Anna would read
them out to her.</p>

<p>"Thank you," was all that Laura responded.</p>

<p>Laura herself wrote a good deal in these days.
What was she writing? And to whom? She sat
at her little desk, shut up in her room, and covered
big sheets of paper with her clear, firm handwriting.
If any one entered, she covered what she
had written with her blotting-paper, and remained
silent, with lowered eyes, toying with her pen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
More than once Anna had come in. Thereupon
Laura had gathered up her manuscripts, and
locked them into a drawer, controlling with an
effort the trouble in her face.</p>

<p>"What are you writing?" Anna asked one day,
overcoming her timidity, and moved by a strange
impulse of curiosity.</p>

<p>"Nothing that would interest you," the other
answered.</p>

<p>"How can you say so?" the elder sister protested,
with indulgent tenderness. "Whatever
pleases you or moves you must interest me."</p>

<p>"Nothing pleases me and nothing moves me,"
Laura said, looking down.</p>

<p>"Not even what you are writing?"</p>

<p>"Not even what I am writing."</p>

<p>"How reserved you are! How close you keep
your secrets! But why should you have any?"
Anna insisted affectionately.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Laura, vaguely. She got up and
left the room, carrying her key with her.</p>

<p>Anna never again referred to what her sister
was writing. It might be letters, it might be a
journal.</p>

<p>In July, Sorrento filled up with tourists and
holiday folk; and the other villas were occupied
by their owners. The sisters were invited about
a good deal, and lured into the thousand summer
gaieties of the town.</p>

<p>One of the earliest arrivals was Luigi Caracciolo.
He came to Sorrento every season, but
usually not till the middle of August, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to spend no more than a fortnight. He had
rather a disdain for Sorrento, he who had travelled
over the whole of Europe. This year he came
in the first week of July; and he was determined
to stay until Anna Dias left. He was genuinely
in love with her; in his own way, of course. The
mystery that hung over her past, and her love for
Cesare Dias, which Luigi knew to be unrequited,
made her all the dearer to him. He was in love,
as men are in love who have loved many times
before. Sometimes he lost his head a little in
her presence, but never more than a little. He
retained his mastery of himself sufficiently to
pursue his own well-proved methods of love-making.
He covered his real passion with a
semblance of levity which served admirably to
compel Anna to tolerate it.</p>

<p>She never allowed him&mdash;especially at Sorrento,
where she was alone and where she was very sad&mdash;to
speak of love; but she could not forbid him
to call occasionally at the Villa Caterina, nor
could she help meeting him here and there in the
town. And Cesare, from Saint-Moritz, kept writing
to her and Laura to amuse themselves, to go
out, saying that he hated women who lived like
recluses. And sometimes he would add a joking
message for Caracciolo, calling him Anna's faithful
cavalier; but she, through delicacy, had not delivered
them.</p>

<p>Luigi did not pay too open a court to her, did
not affect too great an intimacy; but he was never
far from her. For a whole evening he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
hover near her at a party, waiting for the moment
when he might seat himself beside her; he would
leave when she left, and on the pretext of taking
a little walk in the moonlight, would accompany
the two ladies to the door of their house. He
was persevering, with a gentle, continuous, untiring
perseverance that nothing could overcome, neither
Anna's silence, nor her coldness, nor her melancholy.
She often spoke to him of Cesare, and
with so much feeling in her voice that he turned
pale, wounded in his pride, disappointed in his
desire, yet not despairing, for it is always a
hopeful sign when a woman loves, even though
she loves another. Then the only difficulty
(though an immense one) is to change the face of
the man she loves to your own, by a sort of sentimental
sleight of hand.</p>

<p>For various reasons, he was extremely cautious.
He was not one of those who enjoy advertising
their desires and their discomfitures on the walls
of the town. Then, he did not wish to alarm
Anna, and cause her to close her door to him.
And besides, he was afraid of the silent watchfulness
of Laura. The beautiful Minerva and the
handsome young man had never understood each
other; they were given to exchanging somewhat
sharp words at their encounters, a remarkable
proceeding on the part of Laura, who usually
talked little, and then only in brief and colourless
sentences. Her contempt for him was undisguised.
It appeared in her manner of looking him over
when he wore a new suit of clothes, in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
manner of beginning and ending her remarks to
him with the phrase, "A handsome young fellow
like you." That was rather bold, for a girl, but
Laura was over twenty, and both the sisters passed
for being nice, but rather original, nice but
original, as their mother and father had been
before them. Luigi Caracciolo himself thought
them odd, but the oddity of Anna was adorable,
that of Laura made him uneasy and distrustful.
He was afraid that on one day or another, she
might denounce him to Cesare, and betray his
love for the other's wife. She had such a sarcastic
smile sometimes on her lips! And her
laughter had such a scornful ring! He imagined
the most fantastic things in respect of her, and
feared her mightily.</p>

<p>"How strange your sister is," he said once to
Anna, finding her alone.</p>

<p>"She's good, though," said Anna, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Does she seem so to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You little know. You're very ingenuous.
She's probably a monster of perfidy," he said
softly.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that to me, Caracciolo?
Don't you know that I dislike such jokes?"</p>

<p>"If I offend you, I'll hold my tongue. I keep
my opinion, though. Some day you'll agree with
me."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Caracciolo. You distress me."</p>

<p>"It's much better to have no illusions; then
we can't lose them, dear lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is better to lose illusions, than never to have
had them."</p>

<p>"What a deep heart is yours! How I should
like to drown in it! Let me drown myself in
your heart, Anna."</p>

<p>"Don't call me by my name," she said, as if
she had heard only his last word.</p>

<p>"I will obey," he answered meekly.</p>

<p>"You, too, are good," she murmured, absently.</p>

<p>"I am as bad as can be, Signora," he rejoined,
piqued.</p>

<p>She shook her head good-naturedly, with the
smile of one who would not believe in human
wickedness, who would keep her faith intact, in
spite of past delusions. And the more Luigi
Caracciolo posed as a depraved character, the
more she showed her belief that at the bottom
every human soul is good.</p>

<p>"Everybody is good, according to you," he
said. "Then I suppose your husband, Cesare, is
good too?"</p>

<p>"Too? He is the best of all. He is absolutely
good," she cried, her voice softening as it always
did when she spoke of Cesare.</p>

<p>"He who leaves you here alone after a few
months of marriage?"</p>

<p>"But I'm not alone," she retorted, simply.</p>

<p>"You're not alone&mdash;you're in bad company,"
he said, nervously.</p>

<p>"Do you think so? I wasn't aware of it."</p>

<p>"You couldn't tell me more politely that I'm a
nonentity. But he, he who is away, and who no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
doubt invents a thousands pretence to explain his
absence to you&mdash;can you really say that he is
good."</p>

<p>"Cesare invents no pretences for me," she
replied, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Who says so? He? Do you believe him?"</p>

<p>"He says nothing. I have faith in him," she
answered, overwhelmed to hear her own daily fears
thus uttered for her.</p>

<p>Caracciolo looked at her anxiously. Merely to
hear her pronounce her husband's name proved
that she adored him. Luigi was too expert a
student of women not to interpret rightly her
pallor, her emotion, her distress. He did not
know, but he could easily guess that Anna wrote
to Cesare every day, and that he responded rarely
and briefly. He understood how heavy her long
hours of solitude must be, amid the blue and green
of the Sorrento landscape, passed in constant
longing for her husband's presence. He understood
perfectly that she was consumed by secret
jealousy, and that he tortured her cruelly when by
a word, or an insinuation he inspired her with new
suspicions. He could read her heart like an open
book; but he loved her all the better for the
intense passion that breathed from its pages. He
did not despair. Sooner or later, he was convinced,
he would succeed in overcoming the
obstacle in his way. He adopted the ancient
method of assailing the character of the absent
man.</p>

<p>When he would mention some old flame of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Cesare's, or some affair that still continued, and
which his marriage could not break off, or when
he would speak of Cesare's desertion of his young
wife, he saw Anna's face change; he knew the
anguish that he woke in her heart, and he suffered
wretchedly to realise that it was for the love of
another man. His weapon was a double-edged
sword, that wounded her and wounded him. But
what of that? He continued to wield it, believing
that thus little by little he could deface the image
of Cesare Dias that Anna consecrated with her
adoration.</p>

<p>Anna was always ready to talk of her husband,
and that gave him his opportunity for putting in
his innuendoes. At the same time it caused him
much bitterness of spirit, and sometimes he would
say, "We are three. How do you do, Cesare?"
bowing to an imaginary presence.</p>

<p>Anna's eyes filled with tears at such moments.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, forgive me," he cried. "But
when you introduce his name into our conversation,
you cause me such agony that I feel I am
winning my place in heaven. Go on: I am
already tied to the rack; force your knife into my
heart, gentle torturess."</p>

<p>And she, at first timidly, but then with the
impetuousness of an open and generous nature,
would continue to talk of Cesare. Where was he,
what was he doing, when would he return? she
would ask; and he by-and-by would interrupt
her speculations to suggest that Cesare was probably
just now on the Righi, with the Comtesse de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Béhague, one of his old French loves, whom he
met every year in Switzerland; and that he would
very likely not return to Sorrento at all, nor even
to Naples before the end of October.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, I don't believe it," she
protested.</p>

<p>"You don't believe it? But it's his usual habit.
Why should he alter it this year?"</p>

<p>"He has me to think of now."</p>

<p>"Ah, dear Anna, dear Anna, he thinks of you
so little!"</p>

<p>"Don't call me by my name," she said, making a
gesture to forbid him.</p>

<p>"If Cesare heard me he wouldn't like it&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"You hope so, dear lady, which is a very
different thing. But he's not jealous."</p>

<p>"No; he's not jealous," she repeated, softly,
lost in sorrowful meditations. "But what man
is?"</p>

<p>"He's a man who has never thought of anything
but his own pleasure."</p>

<p>"Sad, sad," she murmured very low.</p>

<p>Yet, though she thoroughly well understood
that a better knowledge of her husband's past life
could only bring her greater pain, she began to
question Luigi Caracciolo about Cesare's adventures.
Ah, how ashamed she was to do so! It
seemed like violating a confidence; like desecrating
an idol that she had erected on the altar of her
heart. It seemed like breaking the most sacred
condition of love, which is secrecy, to speak thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of her love to a man who loved her. Yet the
temptation was too strong for her. And cautiously,
by hints, she endeavoured to draw from Caracciolo
some fact, some episode, a detail, a name, a date;
she would try to ask indifferently, feigning a slight
interest, attempting without success to play the
woman of wit&mdash;she, poor thing, who was only a
woman of heart.</p>

<p>Caracciolo understood at once, and for form's
sake assumed a certain reluctance. Then, as if
won by her wishes, he would speak; he would
give her a fact, an episode, a date, a name, commenting
upon it in such wise as, without directly
speaking ill of Cesare, to underline his hardness
of heart and his incapacity for real passion. It
was sad wisdom that Anna hereby gained. Her
husband's soul was cold and arid; he had always
been the same; nothing had ever changed him.
Sometimes, sick and tired, she would pray
Caracciolo by a gesture to stop his talk; she
would remain thoughtful and silent, feeling that
she had poured a corrosive acid into her own
wounds. Sometimes Laura would be present at
these conversations, beautiful, in white garments,
with soft, lovely eyes. She listened to Caracciolo
with close attention, whilst an inscrutable smile
played on her virginal lips. He, in deference
to the young girl's presence, would, from time to
time, drop the subject; then Laura would look at
him with an expression of ardent curiosity that
surprised him, a look that seemed to ask a hundred
questions. His narrative of the life of Cesare Dias
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
succeeded in spoiling Anna's holiday, but did not
advance his courtship by an inch.</p>

<p>He has great patience, and unlimited faith in
his method. He knew that a strong passion or a
strong desire can overcome in time the most insurmountable
obstacles. Yet he had moments of
terrible discouragement. How she loved him,
Cesare Dias, this beautiful woman! It was a love
all the more sad to contemplate, because of the
discrepancies of age and character between husband
and wife. Here was a fresh young girl uncomplainingly
supporting the neglect of a worn-out
man of forty.</p>

<p>One day, unexpectedly, Cesare returned. From
his wife's pallor, from her trembling, he understood
how much he had been loved during his absence.
He was very kind to her, very gallant, very tender.
He embraced her and kissed her many times,
effusively, and told her that she was far lovelier
than the ladies of France and Switzerland. He
was in the best of good humours; and she, laughing
with tears in her eyes, and holding his hand
as she stood beside him, realised anew how single
and absolute was her love for him.</p>

<p>Two or three times Cesare asked, "And Laura?"</p>

<p>"She's very well. She'll be coming soon."</p>

<p>"You haven't found her a husband?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't want one."</p>

<p>"That's what all girls say."</p>

<p>"Laura is obstinate. She really doesn't want
one. People even think she would like to become
a nun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense."</p>

<p>"The strange thing is that once when I asked
her if it was true, she answered no."</p>

<p>"She's an odd girl," said Cesare, a little pensively.</p>

<p>"I don't understand her."</p>

<p>"Ah, for that matter, you understand very little
in general," said her husband, caressing her hair to
temper his impertinence.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're right; very little," she answered,
with a happy smile. "I'm an imbecile."</p>

<p>But Laura did not come, though she had been
called. Anna sent her maid. "She would come
at once; she was dressing," was the reply. They
waited for her a few minutes longer; and when
she appeared in the doorway, dazzling in white,
with her golden hair in a rich coil on the top
of her head, Anna cried, "Laura, Cesare has
come."</p>

<p>Cesare rose and advanced to meet his sister-in-law.
She gave him her hand, and he kissed it.
But he saw that she was offering her face; then
he embraced her, kissing her cheek, which was
like the petal of a camellia. This was all over
in an instant, but it seemed a long instant to
Anna; and she had an instinctive feeling of repulsion
when Laura, blushing a little, came up and
kissed her. It was an instinctive caress on the
part of Laura, and an instinctive movement of
repulsion on that of Anna. Not that she had the
faintest evil thought or suspicion; it was a vague
distress, a subtle pain, nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>From that day life in the quiet Villa Caterina
became sensibly gayer; there were visits and receptions,
dances, and yachting parties. It was
an extremely lively season at Sorrento. There
were a good many foreigners in the town; amongst
them two or three wild American girls, who swam,
rowed, played croquet and lawn-tennis, were very
charming, and had handsome dowries. It became
the fashion for the men to make love to these
young persons, a thing that was sufficiently unusual
in a society where flirtation with unmarried
women is supposed to be forbidden. Cesare told
Anna that it was a propitious moment for launching
Laura; she too had a handsome dowry, and
was very lovely, though she lacked perhaps the
vivacity of the wild Americans; and with the
energy of a youth, he took his wife and sister
everywhere.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo continued to make his court
to Anna. With delicate cynicism, Cesare, on his
return, had inquired whether Luigi had faithfully
discharged his duty as her cavalier, but Anna had
turned such talk aside, for it hurt her. Laura,
however, declared that Luigi had accomplished
miracles of devotion, and shown himself a model
of constancy.</p>

<p>"And the lady, what of her?" asked Cesare,
pulling his handsome black moustaches.</p>

<p>"Heartless," Laura answered, smiling at Anna,
for whom this joking was a martyrdom.</p>

<p>"Noble but heartless lady!" repeated Cesare.</p>

<p>"Would you have wished me to be otherwise?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
demanded Anna, quickly, looking into her husband's
eyes.</p>

<p>"No; I should not have wished it," was his
prompt rejoinder.</p>

<p>In spite of this downright pronouncement, in
which her husband, for all his cynicism, asserted
his invincible right to her fidelity&mdash;in spite of the
fact that Cesare appeared to watch the comings
and goings of Caracciolo&mdash;he openly jested with
his wife's follower about his courtship.</p>

<p>"Well, how is it getting on, Luigi?" he asked
one day.</p>

<p>"Badly, Cesare. It couldn't be worse," responded
Luigi, with a melancholy accent that
was only half a feint.</p>

<p>"And yet I left the field free to you."</p>

<p>"Yes; you are as generous as the emperors
your namesakes; but when you have captured a
province you know how to keep it, whether you
are far or near."</p>

<p>"Men of my age always do, Luigi."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have a different tradition."</p>

<p>"What tradition?"</p>

<p>"You don't love."</p>

<p>"What! Do you mean to say that you
young fellows love?" asked Cesare, lifting his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, you know, we commit that folly."</p>

<p>"It's a mistaken method&mdash;a grave blunder. I
hope that you've not fallen into it."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Luigi, looking mysterious.
"Besides, your question strikes me as prompted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
by jealousy. I'll say no more. It might end in
bloodshed."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," laughed Cesare.</p>

<p>"But you'll drive me to despair, Dias. Don't
you see that your confidence tortures me. For
heaven's sake, do me the favour of being
jealous."</p>

<p>"Anything to oblige you, my dear fellow, except
that. I've never been jealous of a woman in my
life."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;. One day or another I'll tell
you." And putting his arm through Luigi's he
led him into the drawing-room of the Hotel
Vittoria.</p>

<p>Such talks were frequent between them; on
Cesare's side calm and ironical, on Luigi's sometimes
a little bitter. On their family outings,
Cesare always gave his arm to Laura, for he held
it ridiculous for a husband to pair off with his
wife; and Caracciolo would devote himself to
Anna. Cesare would make him a sign of intelligence,
laughing at his assiduity.</p>

<p>"Rigidly obeying orders, eh?" asked the sarcastic
husband.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it's she who's given me my orders,"
answered the other, sadly.</p>

<p>"But really, Anna, you're putting to death
the handsomest lad in Christendom!" exclaimed
Cesare.</p>

<p>"The world is the richer for those who die of
love," she returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sentimental aphorism," said Cesare, with a
cutting ironical smile.</p>

<p>And he went away to dance with Laura.
Between Anna and Luigi there was a long silence.
It was impossible for her to listen to these pleasantries
without suffering. The idea that her
husband could speak thus lightly of another man's
love for her, the idea that he could treat as a
worldly frivolity the daily siege that Caracciolo
was laying to her heart, martyrised her. She was
nothing to him, since he could allow another man
to court her. He never showed a sign of jealousy,
and jealousy pleases women even when they know
it is not sincere. She was angry with Cesare as
much as with Luigi.</p>

<p>"You jest too much about your feelings for
any woman to take them seriously," she said to
the latter, one evening, when they were listening
to a concert of mandolines and guitars.</p>

<p>"You're right," he answered, turning pale.
"But once when I never jested, I had equally
bad luck. You refused to marry me."</p>

<p>He spoke sadly. That she had refused to
marry him still further embittered for him her
present indifference. How could a woman have
refused a rich and handsome youth, for a man
who had passed forty, and was effete in mind
and body? How had Cesare Dias so completely
taken possession of this woman's heart? The
passion of Anna for Cesare, and that of Caracciolo
for Anna, were much talked of in Sorrento society,
and the general opinion was that Dias must be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
tremendous wizard, that he possessed to a supreme
degree the art of attracting men and winning
women, and that everybody was right to love and
worship him. As for Caracciolo, his was the
story of a failure.</p>

<p>Caracciolo himself, moved by I know not what
instinct of loyalty, of vanity, or of subtle calculation,
accepted and even exaggerated his role of an unsuccessful
lover. Wherever he went, at the theatre,
at parties, he showed plainly that he was waiting
for Anna, and was nervous and restless until she
came. His face changed when she entered, bowed
to him, gave him her hand; and when she left he
followed immediately. Perhaps he was glad that
all this should be noticed. He knew he could
never move her by appearing cold and sceptical;
that was Cesare's pose, and in it Luigi could
not hope to rival him. Perhaps her sympathies
would be stirred if she saw him ardent and
sorrowful.</p>

<p>In the autumn he perceived that Anna was
troubled by some new grief. Her joy at the
return of Cesare had given place to a strange
agitation. She was pale and silent, with dark
circles under her eyes. And he realised that
whatever faint liking she had had for himself had
been blotted out by a sorrow whose causes were
unknown to him.</p>

<p>One day he said to her, "Something is troubling
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered frankly.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what it is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I don't wish to," she said, with the same
frankness.</p>

<p>"Am I unworthy of your confidence?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell it to you, I can't. It's too horrible,"
she murmured, with so heart-broken an inflection
that he was silent, fearing lest others should witness
her emotion.</p>

<p>He returned to the subject later on, but without
result. Anna appeared horror-struck by her own
thoughts and feelings. Luigi had numberless
suspicions. Had Anna secretly come to love him?
Or, had she fallen in love with some one else,
some one unknown to him? But he soon saw that
neither of these suppositions were tenable. He
saw that she had not for a moment ceased to love
Cesare Dias, and that her grief, whatever it was,
sprang as usual from her love for him.</p>

<p>For the first week after his return her husband
had been kind and tender to her; then, little by
little, he had resumed his old indifference. He
constantly neglected her. He went out perpetually
with Laura, on the pretext that she was too old
now to be accompanied only by her governess, and
that it was his duty to find a husband for her.
Sometimes Anna went with them, to enjoy her
husband's presence.</p>

<p>Often he and Laura would joke together about
this question of her marriage.</p>

<p>"How many suitors have you?" asked Cesare,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Four who have declared themselves; three or
four others who are a little uncertain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Anna felt herself excluded from their intimacy,
and sought in vain to enter it. It made her exceedingly
unhappy.</p>

<p>She was jealous of her sister, and she hated
herself for her jealousy.</p>

<p>"I am vile and perfidious since I suspect others
of vileness and perfidy," she told herself to.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Cesare could be guilty of
such a dreadful sin, that he could be making love
to Laura?</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? What are you
thinking about?" he asked his wife.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, don't ask me," she exclaimed,
putting her hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>But one evening, when they were alone, and he
again questioned her, she answered, "It's because
I love you so, Cesare, I love you so."</p>

<p>"I know it," he said, with a light smile. "But
it isn't only that, dear Anna."</p>

<p>And he playfully ruffled up her black hair.</p>

<p>"You're right. It isn't only that. I'm jealous
of you, Cesare."</p>

<p>"And of what woman?" he asked, suddenly
becoming cold and imperious.</p>

<p>"Of all women. If you so much as touch a
woman's hand, I am in despair."</p>

<p>"Of women in general?"</p>

<p>"Of women in general."</p>

<p>"Of no one in particular?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment. "Of no one in
particular."</p>

<p>"It's fancy, superstition," he said, pulling his
moustache.</p>

<p>"It's love, love," she cried. "Ah, if you should
love another, I would kill myself."</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll die a violent death," said
he, laughing.</p>

<p>"Remember&mdash;darling&mdash;I would kill myself."</p>

<p>"You'll live to be eighty, and die in your bed,"
he said, still laughing.</p>

<p>For a few days she was reassured. But on the
first occasion, when her husband and Laura again
went out together, her jealousy returned, and she
suffered atrociously. Her conduct became odd
and extravagant. Sometimes she treated Laura
with the greatest kindness; sometimes she was
rude to her, and would leave her brusquely, to go
and shut herself up in her own room.</p>

<p>Laura asked no questions.</p>

<p>"When are we going to leave Sorrento?"
Anna asked. But her husband did not answer,
appearing to wish to prolong their sojourn there.</p>

<p>"Let us go away, I beg you, Cesare."</p>

<p>"So soon? Naples is empty at this season.
There's nothing to do there. We'd have the air
of provincials."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter. Let us go away,
Cesare."</p>

<p>"You are bored, here in the loveliest spot in
the world?"</p>

<p>"Sorrento is lovely, but I want to go away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"As you wish," he said, suddenly consenting.
"Give orders to the servants to make ready."</p>

<p>And, to avenge himself, he neglected her
utterly during the last two or three days, going
off constantly with Laura.</p>

<p>On the eve of their departure Luigi Caracciolo
called, to make his adieux. He found Anna
alone.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Signora Dias," he said, and
the commonplace words had an inflection of
melancholy.</p>

<p>"Good evening. You've not gone to the farewell
dance at the Vittoria?"</p>

<p>"I have no farewells to give except to you."</p>

<p>"Farewell, then," she said, seating herself near
him.</p>

<p>"Farewell," he murmured, smiling, and looking
into her eyes. "But we shall meet again within a
fortnight."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I shall be receiving so
soon. I don't know whether I shall receive at
all."</p>

<p>"You're going to shut your doors to me?" he
asked, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Not to you only, to everybody. I'm not made
for society. I'm out of place in it, out of tune
with it. Solitude suits me better."</p>

<p>"You will die of loneliness. Seeing a few devoted
friends will do you good."</p>

<p>"My troubles are too deep."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you're a little selfish? If
you shut your doors, others will suffer, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
don't care. You are willing to deprive us of the
great pleasure of seeing you. But don't you
know that the pain we give reacts upon ourselves?
Don't be selfish."</p>

<p>"It's true. I'm perhaps selfish. But who of
us is perfect? The most innocent, the purest
people in the world, can make others unhappy,
without wishing to."</p>

<p>He studied her, feeling that he was near to the
secret of her sorrow.</p>

<p>"Sorrento has bored you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not exactly bored me. I have been unhappy
here."</p>

<p>"More unhappy than at Naples?"</p>

<p>"More than at Naples."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I carry my unhappiness with me."</p>

<p>"Did you imagine that Sorrento would make
over the man you love?"</p>

<p>"I hoped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing can make that man over. He's not
bad perhaps; but he's what he is."</p>

<p>"It's true."</p>

<p>"Why, then, do you seek the impossible?" he
went on.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;aren't you seeking the impossible?"
she retorted.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I stop at wishing for it. You see
how reasonable I am. You are sad, very sad,
Anna, and not for my sake, for another's; yet I
should be so happy if I could help you or comfort
you in any way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," she replied, moved.</p>

<p>"I believe that dark days are waiting for you
at Naples. I don't wish to prophesy evil, Anna,
but that is my belief."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," said she, and a sudden desperation
showed itself in her face.</p>

<p>"Well, will you treat me as a friend, and remember
me in your moments of pain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will remember you."</p>

<p>"Will you call me to you?"</p>

<p>"I will call upon you as upon a brother."</p>

<p>"Listen, Anna. Officially I live with my mother
in our old family palace. But my real home is
the Rey Villa in the Chiatamone. I promise
you, Anna, that I am speaking to you now, as I
would speak to my dearest sister. Remember
this, that, beginning a fortnight hence, I will wait
there every day till four o'clock in the afternoon,
to hear from you. I shall be quite alone in the
house, Anna. You can come without fear, if you
need me. Or you can send for me. My dearest
hope will be in some way to serve you. I will
obey you like a slave. Anna, Anna, when your
hour of trouble arrives, remember that I am
waiting for you. When you have need of a
friend's help, remember that I am waiting."</p>

<p>"But why do you give me your life like this?"</p>

<p>"Because it is good to give it thus. You, if
you loved, would you not do the same?"</p>

<p>"I would do the same. I would give my life."</p>

<p>"You see! But forget that word love; it
escaped me involuntarily. It is not the man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
loves you, it is the devoted friend, it is the
brother, whom you are to remember. My every
day will be at your disposal. I swear that no
unhallowed thought shall move me."</p>

<p>"I believe you," she said.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. He kissed it.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<p>Anna was as good as her word, and on her
return to Naples shut herself up in solitude and
silence, receiving no one, visiting no one, spending
much of her time in her own room, going in the
morning for long walks in the hope of tiring herself
out, speaking but little, and living in a sort
of moral somnolence that seemed to dull her
sorrows. Her husband and sister continued to
enjoy their liberty, as they had enjoyed it at
Sorrento. She left them to themselves. She
was alternately consumed by suspicions and remorseful
for them. In vain she sought comfort
from religion, her piety could not bear the contact
of her earthly passion, and was destroyed by it.
She had gone to her confessor, meaning to tell
him everything, but when she found herself kneeling
before the iron grating, her courage failed
her; she dared not accuse her husband and her
sister to a stranger. So she spoke confusedly
and vaguely, and the good priest could give her
only vague consolation.</p>

<p>She abandoned herself to a complete moral
prostration. She passed long hours motionless in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
her easy-chair, or on her bed, in a sort of stupor
and often was absent from table, on one pretext
or another.</p>

<p>"The Signora came home an hour ago, and is
lying down," said Cesare's man-servant.</p>

<p>"Very good. Don't disturb her," returned his
master, with an air of relief.</p>

<p>"The Signora has a headache, and will not
come to luncheon," said Anna's maid to Laura.</p>

<p>"Very good. Stay within call, if she should
wish for anything," responded Laura, serene and
imperturbable.</p>

<p>And Cesare and Laura merrily pursued their
intimacy, never bestowing a thought upon her
whom they thereby wounded in every fibre of her
body, and in the essence of her soul. The anguish
of jealousy is like the anguish of death, and Anna
suffered it to the ultimate pang, at the same time
despising herself for it, telling herself that she was
the most unjust of women. Her sister was purity
itself; her husband was incapable of evil; they
were superior beings, worthy of adoration; and
she was daily thinking of them as criminals, and
covering them with mire. Often and often, in the
rare moments when her husband treated her affectionately,
she longed to open her heart and tell
him everything. But his manner intimidated her,
and she dared not. She wondered whether she
might not be mad, and whether her jealousy was
not the figment of an infirm mind. She had hoped
to find peace in flying from Sorrento; now her
hope was undeceived; and Anna understood that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
her pain came from within, not from without. To
see her sister and her husband together, seated
side by side, walking arm in arm, pressing each
other's hands, looking and smiling at each other,
was more than she could bear; she fled their
presence; she left the house for long wanderings
in the streets, or shut herself up in her own room,
knowing but too well that they would not notice
her absence. Indeed, it would be like a burden
taken from their shoulders, for she was a burden
to them, with her pallor and her speechlessness.</p>

<p>"They are gay, and I bore them," she told
herself.</p>

<p>On several occasions, Cesare twitted her on the
subject of her continual melancholy, demanding
its cause; but Anna, smarting under his sarcasms,
could not answer him. One day, in great
irritation, he declared that she had no right to go
about posing as a victim, for she wasn't a victim,
and her sentimental vapourings bored him
immensely.</p>

<p>"Ah, I bore you; I bore you," cried Anna,
shaking with suppressed sobs.</p>

<p>"Yes, unspeakably. And I hope that some
day or another you'll stop boring me, do you
hear?"</p>

<p>"I had better die. That would be best," she
sighed.</p>

<p>"But can't you live and be less tiresome? Is
it a task, a mission, that you have undertaken, to
bore people?"</p>

<p>"I had better die, better die," she sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>He went off abruptly, cursing his lot, cursing
above all the monstrous error he had made in
marrying this foolish creature. And she, who
had wished to ask his pardon, found herself alone.
Later in the same day she noticed that Laura
treated her with a certain contempt, shrugging her
shoulders at the sight of her eyes red from
weeping.</p>

<p>Anna determined that she would try to take on
at least the external appearances of contentment.
The beautiful Neapolitan winter was beginning.
She had eight or ten new frocks made, and
resolved to become frivolous and vain. Whenever
she went out she invariably met Luigi
Caracciolo; it was as if she had forewarned him
of her itinerary. He had divined it, with that fine
intuition which lovers have. They never stopped
to speak, however; they simply bowed and passed
on. But in his way of looking at her she could
read the words of their understanding&mdash;"Remember,
every day, till four o'clock."</p>

<p>She threw herself into the excitements of
society, going much to the theatre and paying
many calls. Cesare encouraged this new departure.</p>

<p>The people amongst whom she moved agreed
that she was very attractive, but whispered that
one day or another she would do something wild.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something altogether extravagant."</p>

<p>One evening towards the end of January Anna
was going to the San Carlo; it was a first night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
At dinner she asked Laura if she would care to
accompany her.</p>

<p>"No," answered Laura, absently.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I've got to get up early to-morrow morning, to
go to Confession."</p>

<p>"Ah, very well. And you&mdash;will you come,
Cesare?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, hesitating a little.</p>

<p>"Cousin Scibilia is coming too," Anna added.</p>

<p>"Then, if you will permit me, I'll not come till
the second act." And he smiled amiably.</p>

<p>"Have you something to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but we'll come home together."</p>

<p>Anna turned red and white. There was something
half apologetic in her husband's tone, as if
he had a guilty conscience in regard to her. But
what did that matter? The prospect of coming
home together, alone in a closed carriage, delighted
her.</p>

<p>She went to dress for the theatre. She put on
for the first time a gown of blue brocade, with a
long train, bold in colour, but admirably setting
off the rich ivory of Anna's complexion. In her
black hair she fixed three diamond stars. She
wore no bracelets, but round her throat a single
string of pearls. When she was dressed, she sent
for her husband.</p>

<p>"You're looking most beautiful," he said.</p>

<p>He took her hands and kissed them; then he
kissed her fair round arms; and then he kissed
her lips. She thrilled with joy and bowed her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll meet at the theatre," he said, "and come
home together."</p>

<p>She called for the Marchesa Scibilia, who now
lived in the girls' old house in the Via Gerolomini.
And they drove on towards the theatre. But
when they reached the Toledo they were met by
a number of carriages returning. The explanation
of this the two ladies learned under the portico of
the San Carlo. Over the white play-bill a notice
was posted announcing the sudden indisposition of
the prima-donna, and informing the public that
there would accordingly be no performance that
evening. Anna had a lively movement of disappointment,
jumping out of her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i> to read the
notice for herself.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo was waiting in the shadow of
a pillar, sure that she would come.</p>

<p>"Marchesa, you have a very ferocious cousin,"
he said, stepping forward to kiss the old lady's
hand, and laughing at Anna's manifest anger.
Then he bowed to her, and in his eyes there was
the eternal message, "Remember, I wait for you
every day."</p>

<p>She shook her head in the darkness. She was
bitterly disappointed. Her evening was lost&mdash;the
evening during which she had counted upon being
alone with Cesare in their box, alone with him in
the carriage, alone with him at home. And her
beautiful blue gown; she had put it on to no purpose.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" she asked her cousin.</p>

<p>"I'm going home. I don't care to go anywhere
else. And you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going home, too."</p>

<p>She half hoped that she might still find Cesare
at the house, and so have at least a half hour
with him before he went out. He was very slow
about dressing; he never hurried, even when he
had an urgent appointment. Perhaps she would
find him in his room, tying his white tie, putting
a flower in his button-hole. She deposited the
Marchesa Scibilia at the palace in the Via Gerolomini,
and bade her coachman hurry home.</p>

<p>"Has the Signore gone out?" she asked the
porter.</p>

<p>No, he had not gone out. The porter was
about to pull his bell-cord, to ring for a footman,
but Anna instinctively stopped him. She wished
to surprise her husband. She put her finger to
her lips, smiling, as she met one of the maids, and
crossed the house noiselessly, arriving thus at the
door of Cesare's room, the door that gave upon
the vestibule, not the one which communicated
with the passage between his room and Anna's.</p>

<p>The door was not locked. She opened it softly.
She would surprise her husband so merrily. But,
having opened the door, she found herself still in
darkness, for Cesare had lowered the two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portières</i>
of heavy olive velvet.</p>

<p>A sudden interior force prevented Anna's lifting
the curtains and showing herself. She remained
there behind them, perfectly concealed, and able
to see and hear everything that went on in the
room, through an aperture.</p>

<p>Cesare was in his dress-suit, with an immaculate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
white waistcoat, a watch-chain that went from
his waistcoat-pocket to the pocket of his trousers,
with a beautiful white gardenia in his button-hole,
his handsome black moustaches freshly curled,
and his whole air one of profound satisfaction.
He was seated in a big leather arm-chair, his fine
head resting on its brown cushions, against which
the pallor of his face stood out charmingly.</p>

<p>He was not alone.</p>

<p>Laura, dressed in that soft white wool which
seemed especially woven for her supple and flowing
figure, with a bouquet of white roses in the cincture
that passed twice loosely round her waist, with
her blonde hair artistically held in place by small
combs of tortoise-shell, and forming a sort of
aureole about her brow and temples, the glory of
her womanly beauty&mdash;Laura was in Cesare's room.</p>

<p>She was not seated on one of his olive velvet
sofas, nor on one of his stools of carved wood,
nor in one of his leather easy-chairs. She was
seated on the arm of the chair in which he himself
reclined; she was seated side wise, swinging
one of her little feet, in a black slipper richly
embroidered with pearls, and an open-work black
silk stocking.</p>

<p>One of her arms was extended across the
cushion above Cesare's head; and, being higher
up than he, she had to bend down, to speak into
his face. She was smiling, a strange, deep smile,
such as had never been seen before upon the
pure red curve of her lips.</p>

<p>Cesare, with his face turned up, was looking at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
her; and every now and then he took her hand
and kissed it, a kiss that lingered, lingered while
she changed colour.</p>

<p>He kissed her hand, and she was silent, and he
was silent; but it was not a sad silence, not a
thoughtful silence. It was a silence in which
they seemed to find an unutterable pleasure.
They found an unutterable pleasure in their
silence, their solitude, their freedom, their intimate
companionship, in the kiss he had just given her,
and which was the forerunner of many others.</p>

<p>Anna had arrived behind the curtain at the
very moment when Cesare was kissing Laura's
hand. She saw them gazing into each other's
eyes, speechless with their emotion. Anna could
hear nothing but the tumultuous beating of her
own heart, a beating that leapt up to her throat,
making it too throb tumultuously.</p>

<p>The fine white hand of Laura remained in
Cesare's, softly surrendered to him; then, as if
the mere contact were not enough, his and her
fingers closely interlaced themselves. The girl,
who had not removed her eyes from his, smiled
languorously, as if all her soul were in her hand,
joined now for ever to the hand of Cesare; a
smile that confessed herself conquered, yet proclaimed
herself triumphant.</p>

<p>They did not speak. But their story spoke
for itself.</p>

<p>Anna saw how close they were to each other,
saw how their hands were joined, saw the glances
of passionate tenderness that they exchanged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Clearly, in every detail, she witnessed this silent
scene of love. Her heart, her temples, her pulses,
pounded frightfully; her nerves palpitated; and
she said to herself:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am dreaming, I am dreaming."</p>

<p>Like one dreaming, indeed, she was unable to
move, unable to cry out; her tongue clove to the
roof of her mouth; she could not lift the curtains;
she could not advance, she could not tear
herself away. She could only stand there rigid
as stone, and behold the dreadful vision. Every
line of it, every passing expression on Cesare's
or Laura's face, burned itself into her brain with
fierce and terrible precision. And in her tortured
heart she was conscious of but one mute, continuous,
childlike prayer&mdash;not to see any longer
that which she saw&mdash;to be freed from her nightmare,
waked from her dream. And all her inner
forces were bent upon the effort to close her eyes,
to lower her eyelids, and put a veil between her
and that sight. Her prayer was not answered;
she could not close her eyes.</p>

<p>Laura took her bouquet of white roses from her
belt, and playfully struck Cesare's shoulder with
them. Then she raised them to her face, breathing
in their perfume, and kissing them. Smiling,
she offered Cesare the roses that she had kissed,
and he with his lips drank her kisses from them.
After that, she kissed them again, convulsively,
turning away her head. Their eyes burned, his
and hers. Again he sought her kisses amongst
the roses; and she put down her face to kiss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
them anew, at the same time with him. And
slowly, from the cold, fragrant roses, their lips
turned, and met in a kiss. Their hands were
joined, their faces were near together, their lips
met in a kiss, and their eyes that had burned,
softened with fond light.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am mad," Anna said to herself,
hearing the wild blows of the blood in her brain.</p>

<p>And, to make sure, wishing to be convinced
that it was all an hallucination, she prayed that
they might speak; perhaps they were mere
phantoms sent to kill her. No sound issued from
their lips.</p>

<p>"Lord, Lord&mdash;a word," she prayed in her heart.
"A sound&mdash;a proof that they are real, or that
they are spectres."</p>

<p>She heard, indeed, a deep sigh. It came from
Laura, after their long kiss. The girl jumped up,
freed her hands from Cesare's, and took two or
three steps into the room. She was nearer to
Anna now. Her cheeks were red, her hair was
ruffled; and she, with a vague, unconscious
movement, lifted it up behind her ears. Her lips
were parted in a smile that revealed her dazzling
teeth. Her gaze wandered, proud and sad.</p>

<p>"Heaven, heaven give her strength to go away.
Give her strength, give me strength," prayed Anna,
in her dream, in her madness.</p>

<p>But Laura had not the strength to go away.
She returned to Cesare; she sat down at his feet,
looking up at him, smiling upon him, holding his
hand, adoring him. And Cesare, his eyes filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with tears, kissed her lips again and again&mdash;a
torrent of kisses.</p>

<p>"Cesare cannot weep. They are phantoms. I
am mad," said Anna. A terrible fire leapt from
her heart to her brain, making her tremble as in a
fever; and then a sudden cold seemed to freeze
her. She had heard. These phantoms had
spoken. They were a man and a woman; they
were her husband, Cesare, and her sister Laura.
Laura had drawn away from Cesare's fury of
kisses, and was standing beside him, while he,
still seated, held her two hands. They were
smiling upon each other.</p>

<p>"Do you love me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I love you," answered Laura.</p>

<p>"How much do you love me?"</p>

<p>"So much! So much!"</p>

<p>"But how much?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;how long will you love me, Laura?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>Now Anna was shivering with cold. She was
not mad. She was not dreaming. Her teeth
chattered. It seemed as if she had been standing
there for a century. She dreaded being discovered,
as if she were guilty of a crime. But she could
not move, she could not go away. It was too
much, too much; she could not endure it! She
covered her mouth with her fan, to suffocate her
voice, to keep from crying out, and cursing God
and love. Laura began to speak.</p>

<p>"Do you love me?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I love you."</p>

<p>"How much do you love me?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Laura."</p>

<p>"How long have you loved me?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>"How long will you love me?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>Unendurable, unendurable! A wild anger
tempted Anna to enter the room, to tear down
the curtains, to scream. It was unendurable.</p>

<p>Cesare said to Laura, very softly, "Go away
now."</p>

<p>"Why, love?"</p>

<p>"Go away. It is late. You must go."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're a bad love&mdash;bad!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that. Don't look like that. Go
away, Laura."</p>

<p>And fondly, he put his arm round her waist and
led her to the door.</p>

<p>She moved reluctantly, leaning her head upon
his shoulder, looking up at him tenderly.</p>

<p>At the door they kissed again.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, love," said Laura.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, love," said Cesare.</p>

<p>The girl went away.</p>

<p>Cesare came back, looking exhausted, deathlike.
He lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>Anna, holding her breath, crossed the vestibule,
the smoking-room, the drawing-room, and at last
reached her own room, and shut her door behind
her. She had run swiftly, instinctively, with the
instinct that guides a wounded animal. Her maid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
came and knocked. She called to her that she
did not need her. Then some one else knocked.</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna," said the calm voice of her husband.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" She had to lean on a
chair, to keep from falling; her voice was dull.</p>

<p>"Was there no performance? Or were you
ill?"</p>

<p>"There was no performance."</p>

<p>"Have you just returned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just returned." But the lie made her blush.</p>

<p>"And your Highness is invisible? I should like
to pay your Highness my respects."</p>

<p>"No," she answered, with a choking voice.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, love," he called.</p>

<p>"Oh, infamous, infamous!" she cried.</p>

<p>But he had already moved away, and did not
hear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a long while she lay on her bed, burying
her face in her pillow, biting it, to keep down her
sobs. She was shivering with cold, in spite of
the feather coverlet she had drawn over her. All
her flesh and spirit were in furious revolt against
the thing that she had seen and heard.</p>

<p>She rose, and looked round her room. It was
in disorder&mdash;the dress she had worn, her fan, her
jewels tossed pell-mell hither and thither. Slowly,
with minute care, she gathered these objects up,
and put them in their places.</p>

<p>Then she rang the bell.</p>

<p>Her maid came, half asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked Anna, forgetting
that on the table beside her stood the clock that
Cesare had given her.</p>

<p>"It's one," responded the maid.</p>

<p>"So late?" inquired her mistress. "You may
go to bed."</p>

<p>"And your Excellency?"</p>

<p>"You can do nothing for me."</p>

<p>But the maid began to smooth down the bed.
Feeling the pillow wet with tears, she said, with
the affectionate familiarity of Neapolitan servants,
"Whoever is good suffers."</p>

<p>The words went through her heart like a knife.
Perhaps the servant knew. Perhaps she, Anna,
had been the only blind member of the household.
The whole miserable story of her desertion
and betrayal was known and commented upon by
her servants; and she was an object of their pity!
Whoever is good suffers!</p>

<p>"Good night, your Excellency, and may you
sleep well," said the maid.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Good-night."</p>

<p>She was alone again. She had not had the
courage to ask whether her husband had come
home; he was most probably out, amusing himself
in society.</p>

<p>For a half hour she lay on her sofa; then she
got up. A big lamp burned on her table, but
before going away her maid had lighted another
lamp, a little ancient Pompeian lamp of bronze
that in old times had doubtless lighted Pompeian
ladies to their trysts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Anna took this lamp and left her room. The
house was dark and silent. She moved towards
Laura's room; and suddenly she remembered
another night, like this, when she had stolen through
a dark sleeping house to join Giustino Morelli on
the terrace, and offer to fly with him. Giustino
Morelli, who was he? what was he? A shadow, a
dream. A thing that had passed utterly from her life.</p>

<p>At her sister's door she paused for a moment,
then she opened it noiselessly, and guided by the
light of her lamp, approached her sister's bed.
Laura was sleeping peacefully; Anna held up her
lamp and looked at her.</p>

<p>She smiled in her sleep.</p>

<p>"Laura!" Anna called, so close to her that her
breath fell on her cheek. "Laura!"</p>

<p>Her sister moved slightly, but did not wake.</p>

<p>"Laura! Laura!"</p>

<p>Her sister sat up. She appeared frightened for
a moment, but then she composed herself with
an effort.</p>

<p>"It is I, Laura," said Anna, putting her lamp
on a table.</p>

<p>"I see you," returned Laura.</p>

<p>"Get up and come with me."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Get up and come, Laura."</p>

<p>"Where, Anna?"</p>

<p>"Get up and come," said Anna, implacably.</p>

<p>"I won't obey you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll come," cried Anna, with an imperious
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're mistaken. I'll not come."</p>

<p>"You'll come, Laura."</p>

<p>"No, Anna."</p>

<p>"You're very much afraid of me then?"</p>

<p>"Here I am. I'll go where you like," Laura
said, proudly, resenting the imputation of fear.
And she began to dress.</p>

<p>Anna waited for her, standing up. Laura
proceeded calmly with her toilet. But when she
came to put on her frock of white wool, Anna had
a mad access of rage, and covered her face with
her hands, to shut out the sight. Four hours ago,
only four hours ago, in that same frock, Laura
had been kissed by Cesare. Her sister seemed
to her the living image of treachery.</p>

<p>Laura moved about the room as if she was
hunting for something.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"I am looking for something."</p>

<p>And she drew from under a pocket-handkerchief
her bunch of white roses.</p>

<p>"Throw those flowers away," cried Anna.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Throw those flowers away, Laura, Laura."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"By our Lady of Sorrows, I beseech you,
throw them away."</p>

<p>"You have threatened me. You have no
further right to beseech me," said Laura quietly,
putting the flowers in her belt.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" cried Anna, pressing her hands to
her temples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us go," she said at last.</p>

<p>Laura followed her across the silent house to
her room.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Anna.</p>

<p>"I am waiting," said Laura.</p>

<p>"Then you don't understand?" asked Anna,
smiling.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I understand nothing."</p>

<p>"Can't you imagine?"</p>

<p>"I have no imagination."</p>

<p>"And your heart&mdash;does your heart tell you
nothing, Laura? Laura, Laura, does your
conscience tell you nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the other quietly, lifting up
the rich blonde hair behind her ears. The same
gesture that Anna had seen her make in Cesare's
room.</p>

<p>"Laura, you are my husband's mistress," Anna
said, raising her arms towards heaven.</p>

<p>"You're mad, Anna."</p>

<p>"My husband's mistress, Laura."</p>

<p>"You're mad."</p>

<p>"Oh, liar, liar! Disloyal and vile woman, who
has not even the courage of her love!" cried
Anna, starting up, with flaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Beware, Anna, beware. Strong language at a
moment like this is dangerous. Say what you've
got to say clearly; but don't insult me. Don't
insult me, because your diseased imagination
happens to be excited. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, heavens!" exclaimed Anna.</p>

<p>"But you can see for yourself, you're mad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
You see, you have nothing to say to justify your
insults."</p>

<p>"Oh, Madonna, Madonna, give me strength,"
prayed Anna, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"Do you see?" asked Laura. "You've called
me here to vilify my innocence."</p>

<p>"Laura," said poor Anna, trembling, "Laura,
it's no guess of mine, no inference, that you are
my husband's mistress. I have not read it in any
anonymous letter. No servant has told me it.
In such a case as this no one has a right to
believe an anonymous letter or a servant's denunciation.
One cannot on such grounds withdraw
one's respect from a person whom one
loves."</p>

<p>"Well, Anna."</p>

<p>"But I have seen, I have seen," she cried, prey
to so violent an emotion that it seemed to her as
if the thing she had seen was visible before her
again.</p>

<p>"What have you seen?" asked Laura, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, horrible, horrible," cried Anna, remembering
her vision.</p>

<p>"What have you seen?" repeated Laura,
seizing Anna's arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a dreadful thing, what a dreadful
thing," she sobbed, covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>But Laura was herself consumed with anger
and pain; and she drew Anna's hands from her
face, and insisted, "Now&mdash;at this very moment&mdash;you
have got to tell me what you have seen. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>And the other, turning pale at her threatening
tone, replied: "You wish to know what I have
seen, Laura? And you ask me in a rage of
offended innocence, of wounded virtue? You are
angry, Laura? Angry&mdash;you? What right have
you to be angry, or to speak to me as you have
done? Aren't you afraid? Have you no fear,
no suspicions, nothing? You threaten me; you
tell me I am mad. You want to know what I
have seen; and you are haughty because you
deem yourself secure, and me a madwoman. But,
to be secure, you should close the doors behind
you when you go to an assignation. When you
are speaking of love, and kissing, to be secure you
should close the doors, Laura, close the doors."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," murmured Laura,
very pale.</p>

<p>"This evening, at nine o'clock, when you were
in Cesare's room&mdash;I came home suddenly&mdash;you
weren't expecting me&mdash;you were alone, secure&mdash;and
I saw through the door&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" demanded the other, with bowed
head.</p>

<p>"As much as can be seen and heard.
Remember."</p>

<p>Laura fell into a chair.</p>

<p>"Why have you done this? Why? Why?"
asked Anna.</p>

<p>Laura did not answer.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to answer? Oh, see how
base you are! See how perfidious you are. What
manner of woman are you? Why did you do it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I love Cesare."</p>

<p>"O Lord, Lord!" cried Anna, breaking into
desperate sobs.</p>

<p>"Don't you know it? Haven't your eyes seen
it? haven't your ears heard it? Do you imagine
that a woman such as I am goes into a man's
room if she doesn't love him! That she lets
him kiss her, that she kisses him, unless she
loves him! What more have you to ask! I love
Cesare."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet," said Anna.</p>

<p>"And Cesare loves me," Laura went on.</p>

<p>"Be quiet. You are my sister. You are a
young girl. Don't speak such an infamy. Be
quiet. Don't say that you and Cesare are two
monsters."</p>

<p>"You have seen us together. I love Cesare,
and he loves me."</p>

<p>"Monstrous, infamous!"</p>

<p>"It may be infamous, but it is so."</p>

<p>"But don't you realise what you are doing!
Don't you feel that it is infamous; Don't you
understand how dreadful your offence is! Am I
not your sister&mdash;I whom you are betraying!"</p>

<p>"I loved Cesare from the beginning. You betrayed
me."</p>

<p>"The excuse of guilt! I loved him, I love
him. You are betraying me."</p>

<p>"You love him stupidly, and bore him; I love
him well."</p>

<p>"He's a married man."</p>

<p>"He was married by force, Anna."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is my husband."</p>

<p>"Oh, very slightly!"</p>

<p>"Laura!" exclaimed Anna, wounded to the
quick, she who was all wounds.</p>

<p>"I'm not blind," said Laura, tranquilly. "I can
take in the situation."</p>

<p>"But your conscience! But your religion!
But your modesty, which is soiled by such an
atrocious sin!"</p>

<p>"I'm not your husband's mistress, you know
that yourself."</p>

<p>"But you love him. You thrill at the touch
of his hand. You kiss him. You tell him you
love him."</p>

<p>"Well, all that doesn't signify that I'm his
mistress."</p>

<p>"The sin is as great."</p>

<p>"No, it's not as great, Anna."</p>

<p>"It's a deadly sin merely to love another
woman's husband."</p>

<p>"But I'm not his mistress. Be exact."</p>

<p>"A change of words; the sin is the same."</p>

<p>"Words have their importance; they are the
symbols of facts."</p>

<p>"It's an infamy," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Anna, don't insult me."</p>

<p>"Insult you! Do you pretend that that pretty
pure face of yours is capable of blushing under an
insult? Can your chaste brow be troubled by an
insult? You have trampled all innocence and all
modesty under foot&mdash;you, the daughter of my
mother! You have broken your sister's heart&mdash;you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the daughter of the same mother! And now
you say that I insult you. Good!"</p>

<p>"You have no right to insult me."</p>

<p>"I haven't the right? Before such treachery?
I haven't the right? Before such dishonour?"</p>

<p>"If you will call upon your memory, you will see
that you haven't the right."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to remember?"</p>

<p>"A single circumstance. Once upon a time,
you, a girl like me, abandoned your home, and
eloped with a man you loved, a nobody, a poor
obscure nobody. Then you deceived me, Cesare,
and everybody else. By that elopement you dishonoured
the graves of your father and mother,
and you dishonoured your name which is also
mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, heavens, heavens!" cried Anna.</p>

<p>"You passed a whole day out of Naples, in an
inn at Pompeii, alone the whole day with a man
you loved, in a private room."</p>

<p>"I wasn't Giustino Morelli's mistress."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Nor am I Cesare Dias'."</p>

<p>"I wasn't Giustino Morelli's mistress," repeated
Anna.</p>

<p>"I wasn't behind the door, as you were, to see
the truth."</p>

<p>"Oh, cruel, wicked sister&mdash;cruel and wicked!"</p>

<p>"And please to have the fairness to remember
that on that day Cesare Dias rushed to your
rescue. In charity, without saying a word to
reproach you, he brought you back to the home
you had deserted. In charity, without insulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
you, I opened my arms to welcome you. In
charity we nursed you through your long illness,
and never once did we reproach you. You see,
you see, you're unjust and ungrateful."</p>

<p>"But you have wounded me in my love, Laura.
But I adore Cesare, and I am horribly jealous of
him. I can't banish the thought of your love for
him; I can remember nothing but your kisses. I
feel as if I were going mad. Oh, Laura, Laura,
you who were so pure and beautiful, you who are
worthy of a young man's love, why do you throw
away your life and your honour for Cesare?"</p>

<p>"But you? Don't you also love him? You
too are young. Yet didn't you love him so
desperately that you would gladly have died, if
he hadn't married you? I have followed your
example, that is all. As you love him, I love
him, Anna. We are sisters, and the same passion
burns in our veins."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, don't say it. My love will
last as long as my life, Laura."</p>

<p>"And so will mine."</p>

<p>"Don't say it, don't say it."</p>

<p>"Until I die, Anna."</p>

<p>"Don't say it."</p>

<p>"My blood is like yours; my nerves are like
yours; my heart is as ardent as yours. My soul
is consumed with love, as yours is. We are the
daughters of the same parents. Cesare has fascinated
you, Cesare has fascinated me."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, heavens! I must kill myself
then. I must die!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bah!" said Laura, with a movement of
disdain.</p>

<p>"I will kill myself, Laura."</p>

<p>"Those who say it don't do it."</p>

<p>"You are deceiving yourself, wicked, scornful
creature."</p>

<p>"Those who say it don't do it," repeated Laura,
laughing bitterly.</p>

<p>"But understand me! I can't endure this
betrayal. Understand! I&mdash;I alone have the
right to love Cesare. He is mine. I won't give
him up to anybody. My only refuge, my only
comfort, my only consolation is in my love. Don't
you see that I have nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Luigi Caracciolo loves you, though," said Laura,
smiling.</p>

<p>"What are you saying to me?"</p>

<p>"You might fall in love with him."</p>

<p>"You propose an infamy to me."</p>

<p>"But consider. I love Cesare; Cesare loves me
and not you. But Caracciolo loves you. Well,
why not fall in love with him?"</p>

<p>"Because it would be infamous."</p>

<p>"You are beginning to insult me again, Anna.
It is late. I am going away."</p>

<p>"No, don't go yet, Laura. Think how terrible
this thing is for me. Listen to me, Laura, and
call to aid all your kindness. I have insulted you,
it is true; but you can't know what jealousy is
like, you can't imagine the unendurable torture of
it. Call to aid your goodness, Laura. Think&mdash;we
were nourished at the same breast, the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
mother's hands caressed us. Think&mdash;we have
made our journey in life together. Laura, Laura,
my sister! You have betrayed me; you have
outraged me; in the past seven hours I have
suffered all that it is humanly possible to suffer;
you can't know what jealousy is like. Don't be
impatient. Listen to me. It is a terrible moment.
Don't laugh. I am not exaggerating. Listen to
me carefully. Laura, all that you have done, I
forget it, I forgive it. Do you hear? I forgive
you. I am sure your heart is good. You will
understand all the affection and all the meekness
there are in my forgiveness."</p>

<p>And as if it were she who were the guilty one,
she knelt before her sister, taking her hand, kissing
it, bathing it with her tears. Laura, seeing this
woman whom she had so cruelly wronged kneel
before her, closed her eyes, and for a moment was
intensely pale. But her soul was strong; she was
able to conquer her emotion. For an instant she
was silent; then, coming to the supreme question
of their existence, she demanded: "And what do
you expect in exchange for this pardon?" She
had the air of according a favour.</p>

<p>"Laura, Laura, you must be good and great,
since I have forgiven you."</p>

<p>"What is your price for this forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"You must not love Cesare any more. Bravely
you must cast that impure love out of your soul,
which it degrades. You must not love him any more.
And then, not only will my pardon be complete
and absolute, but you will find in me the fondest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and tenderest of sisters. I will devote my life to
proving to you how much I love you. My sole
desire will be to make you happy; I will be your
best and surest friend. But you must be good
and strong, Laura; you must remember that you
are my sister; you must forget Cesare."</p>

<p>"Anna, I cannot."</p>

<p>"Listen, listen. Don't answer yet. Don't
decide yet. Don't speak the last word yet, the
awful word. Think, Laura, it is your future, it is
your life, that you are staking upon this love: a
black future, a fatal certainty of death, if you
persist in it. But, on the contrary, if you forget
it&mdash;if a chaste and innocent impulse of affection
for me persuades you to put it from you&mdash;what
peace, what calm! You will find another man, a
worthier man, a man of your own loftiness of
spirit, who will understand you, who will make
you happy, whom you can love with all your soul,
in the consciousness of having done your duty.
You will be a happy wife, your husband will be
a happy man, you will be a mother, you will have
children&mdash;you will have children, you! But you
must not love Cesare any more."</p>

<p>"Anna, I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Laura, don't make your mind up yet. For
pity's sake, hear me. We must find a way out of
it, an escape. You will travel, you will make a
journey, a long journey, abroad; that will interest
you. I'll ask Cousin Scibilia to go with you.
She has nothing to detain her; she's a widow;
she will go. You will travel. You can't think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
how travelling relieves one's sufferings. You will
see new countries, beautiful countries, where your
mind will rise high above the petty, every-day
miseries of life. Laura, Laura, see how I pray
you, see how I implore you. We have the same
blood in our veins. We are children of the
same mother. You must not love Cesare any
more."</p>

<p>"Anna, I can't help it."</p>

<p>Anna moved towards her sister; but when she
found herself face to face with her, an impulse of
horror repelled her. She went to the window
and stood there, gazing out into the street, into
the great shadow of the night. When she came
back, her face was cold, austere, self-contained.
Her sister felt that she could read a menace
in it.</p>

<p>"Is that your last word?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"My last word."</p>

<p>"You don't think you can change?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"You know what you are doing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"And you face the danger?"</p>

<p>"Where is the danger?" asked Laura, rising.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid," said Anna,
carrying her pocket-handkerchief to her lips and
biting it. "I ask you if it doesn't strike you as
dangerous that two women such as I, Anna Dias,
and you, Laura Acquaviva, should live together in
the same house and love the same man with the
same passion?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is certainly very dangerous," said Laura
slowly, standing up, and looking into her sister's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Leave me my husband, Laura," cried Anna,
impetuously.</p>

<p>"Take him back&mdash;if you can. But you can't,
you know. You never could."</p>

<p>"You're a monster. Go away," cried Anna,
clenching her teeth, clenching her fists, driving
her nails into her flesh.</p>

<p>"It's at your bidding that I'm here. I came
to show that I wasn't afraid of you, that's all."</p>

<p>"Go away, monster, monster, monster!"</p>

<p>"Kill me, if you like; but don't call me by
that name," cried Laura, at last exasperated.</p>

<p>"You deserve that I should kill you, it is true.
By all the souls that hear me, by the souls of our
dead parents, by the Madonna, who, with them,
is shuddering in heaven at your crime, you deserve
that I should kill you!"</p>

<p>"But Cesare would weep for me," taunted
Laura, again mistress of herself.</p>

<p>"It is true," rejoined Anna, icily. "Go away
then. Go at once."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Anna."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Laura."</p>

<p>Leisurely, collectedly, she turned her back upon
her sister, and moved away, erect and supple in
her white frock, with her light regular footstep.
Her hand turned the knob of the door, but on the
threshold she paused, involuntarily, and looked
at Anna, who stood in the middle of the room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
with her head bowed, her cheeks colourless, her
eyes expressionless, her lips violet and slightly
parted, testifying to her fatigue. Laura's hesitation
was but momentary. Shrugging her shoulders at
that spectacle of sorrow, she closed the door
behind her, and went off through the darkness to
her own room.</p>

<p>Anna was alone. And within herself she was
offering up thanks to the Madonna for having that
night saved her from a terrible temptation. For,
from the dreadful scene that had just passed,
only one thought remained to her. She had
besought her sister not to love Cesare any more,
promising in exchange all the devotion of her
soul and body; and Laura had thrice responded,
obstinately, blindly, "I can't help it." Well,
when for the third time she heard those words, a
sudden, immense fury of jealousy had seized her;
suddenly a great red cloud seemed to fall before
her eyes, and the redness came from a wound in
her sister's white throat, a wound which she had
inflicted; and the pale girl lay at her feet lifeless,
unable for ever to say again that she loved Cesare
and would not cease to love him. Ah, for a
minute, for a minute, murder had breathed in
Anna's poor distracted heart, and she had wished
to kill the daughter of her mother! Now, with
spent eyes, feeling herself lost and dying at the
bottom of an abyss, she uttered a deep prayer of
thanksgiving to God, for that He had swept the
red cloud away, for that He had allowed her to
suffer without avenging herself. Slowly, slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
she sank upon her knees, she clasped her hands,
she said over all the old simple prayers of her
childhood, the holy prayers of innocence, praying
that still, through all the hopeless misery that
awaited her, she might ever be what she had been
to-night, a woman capable of suffering everything,
incapable of revenge. And in this pious longing
her soul seemed to be lifted up, far above all
earthly pain.</p>

<p>All her womanly goodness and weakness were
mingled in her renunciation of revenge.</p>

<p>The violent energy which she had shown in her
talk with Laura had given place to a mortal lassitude.
She remained on her knees, and continued
to murmur the words of her orisons, but now she
no longer understood their meaning. Her head
was whirling, as in the beginning of a swoon.
She dragged herself with difficulty to her bed, and
threw herself upon it, inert as a dead body, in
utter physical exhaustion.</p>

<p>Laura had undone her. The whole long scene
between them repeated itself over and over in her
mind; again she passed from tears to anger, from
jealousy to pleading affection; again she saw her
sister's pure white face, and the cynical smile that
disfigured it, and its hard incapacity for pity, fear,
or contrition. Laura had overthrown her, conquered
her, undone her. Anna had gone to her,
strong in her outraged rights, strong in her
offended love, strong in her knowledge of her
sister's treachery; she had expected to see that
proud brow bend before her, red with shame; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
had expected to see those fair hands clasped and
trembling, imploring pardon; she had expected
to hear that clear voice utter words of penitence
and promises of atonement. But far from that,
far from accepting the punishment she had earned,
the guilty woman had boldly defended her guilt;
she had refused with fierce courage to give way;
she had clung to her infamy, challenging her
sister to do her worst. Anna understood that not
one word that she had spoken had made the least
impression upon Laura's heart, had stirred in it
the faintest movement of generosity or affection;
she understood that from beginning to end she
had failed and blundered, knowing neither how to
punish nor how to forgive.</p>

<p>"I did not kill her. She has beaten me!" she
thought.</p>

<p>And yet Anna was in the right; and Laura, by
all human and all moral law, was in the wrong. To
love a married man, to love her sister's husband,
almost her own brother! Anna was right before
God, before mankind, before Cesare and Laura
themselves. If, when her sister had refused to
surrender her husband to her, she had killed her,
no human being would have blamed her for it.</p>

<p>"And yet I did not kill her. She has beaten
me!"</p>

<p>She tried to find the cause of her defeat, overwhelmed
by the despair with which good people
see wrong and injustice triumph. She sought for
the cause of her defeat, but she could find none,
none. She was right&mdash;according to all laws,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
human and divine, she was in the right; she alone
was right. Oh, her agony was insupportable,
more and more dreadful as she got farther from
the fact, and could see it in its full hideousness,
examine and analyse it in its full infamy.</p>

<p>"Beaten, beaten, beaten! bitterly worsted and
overwhelmed!"</p>

<p>For the third time in her life she had been
utterly defeated. She had not known how to
defend herself; she had not known how to assert
her rights, and conquer. On that fatal day at
Pompeii, when Giustino Morelli had abandoned
her; on that fatal night at Sorrento, when Cesare
Dias had proposed his mephistophelian bargain to
her, whereby she was to renounce love, dignity,
and her every prerogative as a woman and a wife;
at Pompeii and at Sorrento she had been worsted
by those who were in the wrong, by Giustino
Morelli who could not love, by Cesare Dias who
would not.</p>

<p>And now again to-night&mdash;to-night, for the
third time&mdash;betrayed by her husband and her
sister&mdash;she had not known how to conquer. At
Naples, as at Pompeii, as at Sorrento, she who
was in the right had been defeated by one who
was in the wrong.</p>

<p>"But why? why?" she asked herself, in
despair.</p>

<p>She did not know. It was contrary to all
reason and all justice. She could only see the
fact, clear, cruel, inexorable.</p>

<p>It was destiny. A secret power fought against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
her, and baffled every effort she attempted. It
was a fatality which she bore within herself, a
fatality which it was useless to resist. All she
could wish for now was that the last word might
be spoken soon.</p>

<p>"I must seek the last word," she thought.</p>

<p>She rose from her bed, and looked at the clock.
It was four in the morning.</p>

<p>She went to her writing-desk, and, leaning her
head upon her hand, tried to think what she had
come there to do. Then she took a sheet of
paper, and wrote a few words upon it. But when
she read them over, they displeased her; she tore
the paper up, and threw it away. She wrote and
tore up three more notes; at last she was contented
with this one:</p>

<p>"Cesare, I must say something to you at once.
As soon as you read these words, no matter at
what hour of the night or morning, come to my
room.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anna.</span>"</p>

<p>She sealed the note in an envelope, and
addressed it to her husband. She left her room,
to go to his. The door was locked; she could
see no light, hear no sound within. She slipped
the letter through the crack above the threshold.</p>

<p>"Cesare shall speak the last word," she
thought.</p>

<p>She returned to her own room, and threw herself
upon her bed to watch and wait for him.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<p>Anna got up and opened her window, to let in
the sun, but it was a grey morning, grey in sky
and sea. Lead-coloured clouds rested on the
hill of Posillipo; and the wide Neapolitan landscape
looked as if it had been covered with ashes.
Few people were in the streets; and the palm in
the middle of the Piazza Vittoria waved its long
branches languidly in the wintry breeze.</p>

<p>Her eyes were burning and her eyelids were
heavy. She went into her dressing-room and
bathed her face in cold water. Then she combed
her hair and fastened it up with a big gold pin.
And then she put on a gown of black wool, richly
trimmed with jet, a morning street costume.
Was she going out? She did not know. She
dressed herself in obedience to the necessity which
women feel at certain hours of the day to occupy
themselves with their toilets. But when she
came to fasten her brooch, a clover leaf set with
black pearls, that Laura had given her for a
wedding-present, she discovered that one of the
pearls was gone. The clover-leaf brings luck, but
now this one was broken, and its power was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck, and somebody tapped
discreetly at the door. She could not find her
voice, to answer.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said feebly.</p>

<p>Cesare entered, calm and composed, carrying
his hat and ebony walking-stick in his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-morning. Are you going out?" he
asked tranquilly.</p>

<p>"No. I don't know," she answered, with a
vague gesture.</p>

<p>All her nerves were tingling, as she looked at
the traitor's handsome, wasted face, a face so quiet
and smiling.</p>

<p>"You had something to say to me?" he
reminded her, wrinkling his brow a little.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I came home late. I didn't want to disturb
you," he said, producing a cigarette, and asking
permission with a glance to light it.</p>

<p>"You would not have disturbed me."</p>

<p>"I suppose it's nothing of much importance."</p>

<p>"It's a thing of great importance, Cesare."</p>

<p>"As usual," he said, with the shadow of a
smile.</p>

<p>"I swear to you by the memory of my mother
that nothing is more important."</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! Act three, scene four!"
he exclaimed ironically.</p>

<p>"Scene last," she said, dully, tearing a few
beads from her dress, and fingering them.</p>

<p>"So much the better, if we are near the end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
The play was rather long, my dear." He was
tapping his boot with his walking-stick.</p>

<p>"We will cut it short, Cesare. I have a favour
to ask of you. Will you grant it?"</p>

<p>"Ask, oh lovely lady; and in spite of the fact
that last night you closed your door upon me,
here I am, ready to serve you."</p>

<p>"I have a favour to ask, Cesare."</p>

<p>"Ask it, then, before I go out."</p>

<p>"I want to make a long journey with you&mdash;to
be gone a year."</p>

<p>"A second honeymoon? The like was never
known."</p>

<p>"A journey of a year, do you understand?
Take me as your travelling companion, your
friend, your servant. For a year, away from here,
far away."</p>

<p>"Taking with us our sister, our governess, our
dog, our cat, and the whole menagerie?"</p>

<p>"We two alone," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he.</p>

<p>"What is your decision?"</p>

<p>"I will think about it."</p>

<p>"No. You must decide at once."</p>

<p>"What's the hurry? Are we threatened with
an epidemic?"</p>

<p>"Decide now."</p>

<p>"Then I decide&mdash;no," he said.</p>

<p>"And why?" she asked, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Because I won't."</p>

<p>"Tell me your reason."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to travel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have always enjoyed travelling."</p>

<p>"Well, I enjoy it no more. I am tired, I am
old, I will stay at home."</p>

<p>"I implore you, let us go away, far from here."</p>

<p>"But why do you want to go away?"</p>

<p>"Listen. Don't ask me. Say yes."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go away, Anna?"</p>

<p>"Because, I want to go. Do me the favour."</p>

<p>"Is my lady flying from some danger that
threatens her virtue? From some unhappy love?"</p>

<p>"There's something more than my virtue in
danger. I am flying from an unhappy love,
Cesare," she said gravely, shutting her eyes.</p>

<p>"Heavens! And am I to mix myself up in
these tragical complications? No, Anna, no,
I sha'n't budge."</p>

<p>"Is there no prayer that can move you. Will
you always answer no?"</p>

<p>"I shall always say no."</p>

<p>"Even if I begged you at the point of death?"</p>

<p>"Fortunately your health is excellent," he rejoined,
smiling slightly.</p>

<p>"We may all die&mdash;from one moment to another,"
she answered, simply. "Let us go away
together, Cesare."</p>

<p>"I have said no, and I mean no, Anna. Don't
try to change me. You know it's useless."</p>

<p>"Then will you grant me another favour? This
one you will grant."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"Let us go and live alone in the palace in Via
Gerolimini."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that ugly house?"</p>

<p>"Let us live there alone together."</p>

<p>"Alone? How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Alone, you and I."</p>

<p>"Without Laura?"</p>

<p>"Without Laura."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him pleadingly, and in her brown
eyes he must have been able to read the sorrowful
truth. But he had no pity; he would not spare
her the bitter confession of it.</p>

<p>"Be frank," he said, with some severity. "You
wish to separate from your sister!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And why? Tell me the reason."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. I wish to separate from
Laura."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"At once. To-day."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Have you had a quarrel? I'll be
peacemaker."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," she said, with a strange smile.</p>

<p>"If you'll tell me what you've quarrelled about,
I'll make peace between you."</p>

<p>"But why do you ask these questions and make
these offers? I want to separate from my sister.
That is all."</p>

<p>"And I don't wish to," he said, looking coldly
into his wife's eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't wish to be parted from Laura!" she
cried, feeling her feet giving way beneath her.</p>

<p>"I don't indeed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I will go away myself, she cried, her
brain reeling.</p>

<p>"Do as you like," he answered, calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven help me," she murmured, under
her breath, staggering, losing all her strength.</p>

<p>"Now we have come to the fainting-fit," said
Cesare, looking at her scornfully, "and so will end
this scene of stupid jealousy."</p>

<p>"What jealousy! Who has spoken of jealousy?"
she asked haughtily.</p>

<p>"Must I inform you that you have done nothing
else for the past half-hour! It strikes me that
you have lost the little good sense you ever had.
And I give you notice that I'm not going to make
myself ridiculous on your account."</p>

<p>"You wish to stay with Laura!"</p>

<p>"Not only I, but you too. For the sake of the
world's opinion, as well as for our own sakes, we
can't desert the girl. She's been confided to our
protection. It would be a scandal which I'll not
permit you to make. If I have to suffer a hundred
deaths, I'll not allow you to make a scandal.
Do you understand!"</p>

<p>She looked at him, changing colour, feeling that
her last hope was escaping her.</p>

<p>"And then," he went on, "I don't know your
reasons for not wishing to live any longer with
your sister. She's good, she's well-behaved, she's
serious; she gives you no trouble; you have no
right to find fault with her. It's one of your
whims&mdash;it's your everlasting desire to be unhappy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Anyhow, your idiotic caprice will soon enough be
gratified. Laura will soon be married."</p>

<p>"Do you wish Laura to marry!"</p>

<p>"I wish it earnestly."</p>

<p>"You'll be glad of it!"</p>

<p>"Most glad," he answered, smiling.</p>

<p>Ah, in the days of her womanly innocence,
before her mind had been opened to the atrocious
revelations of their treason, she would not have
understood the import of that answer and that
smile; but she knew now the whole depth of
human wickedness. He smiled, and curled his
handsome black moustaches. Anna lost her head.</p>

<p>"Then you are more infamous than Laura," she
cried.</p>

<p>"The vocabulary of Othello," he cried, calmly.
"But, you know, it has been proved that Othello
was epileptic."</p>

<p>"And he killed Desdemona," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Does it strike you that I look like Desdemona?"</p>

<p>"Not you, not you."</p>

<p>"And who then?"</p>

<p>"Laura."</p>

<p>"Your folly is becoming dangerous, Anna."</p>

<p>"Imminently, terribly dangerous, Cesare."</p>

<p>"Fortunately you take it out in words, not in
actions," he concluded, smiling.</p>

<p>She wrung her hands.</p>

<p>"Last night Laura owed her life to a miracle,"
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what has been going on here?" he exclaimed,
agitated, rising to his feet. "And where
is Laura?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fear nothing, fear nothing on her account.
I've not harmed her. She's alive. She's well.
She's very well. No wrinkle troubles her beauty,
no anxiety disturbs her mind. Fear nothing.
She is a sacred person. Your love protects her.
Listen, Cesare; she was here last night alone in
this room with me; and I had over her the right
given me by heaven, given me by men; and I <em>did
not kill her</em>."</p>

<p>Cesare had turned slightly pale; that was all.</p>

<p>"And if it is permitted to talk in your own
high-sounding rhetoric, what was the ground of
your right to kill her?" he asked, looking at the
handle of his walking-stick, and emphasising the
disdainful <em>you</em>.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>"Laura has betrayed me. She's in love with
you."</p>

<p>"Nothing but this was lacking! That Laura
should be in love with me! I'm glad to hear it.
You are sure of it? It's an important matter for
my vanity. Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Don't jeer at me, Cesare. You don't realise
what you are doing. Don't smile like that. Don't
drive me to extremes."</p>

<p>"There are two of you in love with me&mdash;for I
suppose you still love me, don't you? It's a family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
misfortune. But since you both adore me, it's
probably not my fault."</p>

<p>"Cesare, Cesare!"</p>

<p>"And confess that I did nothing to win you."</p>

<p>"You have betrayed me, Cesare. You are in
love with Laura."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Cesare."</p>

<p>"But bear in mind that certainties are somewhat
rare in this world. For the past few minutes
I've been examining myself, to discover if indeed
I had in my soul a guilty passion for Laura.
Perhaps I am mad about her, without knowing it.
But you, who are an expert in these affairs, you
are sure of it. Have the goodness to explain to
me, oh, passionate Signora Dias, in what manner
I have betrayed you, loving your sister. Describe
to me the whole blackness of my treason. Tell
me in what my&mdash;infamy&mdash;consists. Wasn't it
infamy you called it? I'm not learned in the
language of the heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, God! oh, God!" sobbed Anna, her face
buried in her hands, horrified at what she heard
and saw.</p>

<p>"I hope we've not to pass the morning invoking
the Lord, the Virgin, and the Saints. What do
you suppose they care for your idiocy, Anna?
They are too wise; and I should be wiser if I cared
nothing for it, either. But when your rhetoric casts
a slur upon others, it can't be overlooked. I beg
you, Signora Dias, to do your husband the kindness
of stating your accusations precisely. Set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
forth the whole atrocity of his conduct. I fold
my hands, and sit here on this chair like a king
on his judgment-seat. I wait, only adding that
you have already used up a good deal of my
patience."</p>

<p>"But has Laura told you nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my dear lady."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She's gone to church, I hear."</p>

<p>"Quietly gone to church?"</p>

<p>"Do you fancy that all women dance in perpetual
convulsions to the tune of their sentiments,
Signora Dias? No, for the happiness of men, no.
Our dear and wise Minerva has gone to mass, for
to-day is Sunday."</p>

<p>"With that horrible sin on her conscience!
Does she think she can lie even to God? But it's
a sacrilege."</p>

<p>"Ah, we're to have a mystical drama, a passion-play
now, are we? Dear lady, I see that you have
nothing to say to me, and I make my adieux."</p>

<p>He started to go, but she barred the way to
him.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Cesare; don't leave me. Since you
will have it so, you shall hear from my lips, though
they tremble with horror in pronouncing it, the
story of your infamy. I will repeat it to you to-day
as I repeated it to Laura last night; and I hope it
may burn in your heart as it burns in mine. Ah,
you laugh; you have the boldness to laugh. You
treat this talk as a joke. You sneer at my anger.
You would like to get away from me. I annoy you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
My voice wearies you. And what I have to say to
you will perhaps bring a blush of shame even to your
face, corrupt man that you are. But you cannot
leave me. You are obliged to remain here. You
must give me an account of your betrayal. Ah,
don't smile, don't smile; that will do no good;
your smile can't turn me aside. I won't allow
you to leave me. Remember, Cesare, remember
what you did last evening. Remember and be
ashamed. Remember how cruel, how wicked,
how atrocious it was, what happened last evening
between you and my sister. Under my eyes
Cesare, and for long minutes, so that I could have
no doubt. I could not imagine that I was mad or
dreaming. I saw it all, my ears heard the words
you spoke, the sound of your kisses, your long
kisses. I could not doubt. Oh, how horrible it
is for a woman who loves to see the proof that she
is betrayed! What new, unknown capacities for
sorrow open in her soul! Oh, what have you
done to me, Cesare, you whom I adored! You
and my sister Laura, what have you done to me!"</p>

<p>She fell into a chair, crushing her temples
between her hands.</p>

<p>"Is it your habit to listen at doors? It's not
considered good form," said Cesare coldly.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to die, Cesare? How could
you forget that I loved you, that I had given you
my youth, my beauty, all my heart, all my soul,
that I adored you with every breath, that you
alone were the reason for my being? You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
forgotten all this, forgotten that I live only for
you, my love&mdash;you have forgotten it?"</p>

<p>"These sentiments do you honour, though
they're somewhat exaggerated. Buy a book of
manners, and learn that it's not the thing to listen
at doors."</p>

<p>"It was my right to listen, do you understand?
I was defending my love, my happiness, my all;
but the terrible thing I saw has destroyed for
ever everything I cared for."</p>

<p>"Did you really see such a terrible thing?" he
asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"If I should live a thousand years, nothing
could blot it from my mind. Oh, I shall die, I
shall die; I can only forget it by dying."</p>

<p>"You are suffering from cerebral dilatation. It
was nothing but a harmless scene of gallantry&mdash;it
was a jest, Anna."</p>

<p>"Laura said that she loved you. I heard her."</p>

<p>"Of course, girls of her age always say they're
in love."</p>

<p>"She kissed you, Cesare. I saw her."</p>

<p>"And what of that? Girls of her age are
fond of kissing. They're none the worse for it."</p>

<p>"She was in your arms, Cesare, and for so long
a time that to me it seemed a century."</p>

<p>"It's not a bad place, you know, Signora Dias,"
he responded, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, how low, how monstrous! And you,
Cesare, you told her that you loved her. I heard
you."</p>

<p>"A man always loves a little the woman that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
is with him. Besides, I couldn't tell her that I
hated her; it would scarcely have been polite. I
know my book of manners. There's at least one
member of our family who preserves good form."</p>

<p>"Cesare, you kissed her."</p>

<p>"I'd defy you to have done otherwise, if you'd
been a man. You don't understand these
matters."</p>

<p>"On the lips, Cesare."</p>

<p>"It's my habit. It's not a custom of my invention,
either. It's rather old. I suspect it
took its rise with Adam and Eve."</p>

<p>"But she's a young girl, an innocent young
girl, Cesare."</p>

<p>"Girls are not so innocent as they used to be,
Anna. I assure you the world is changing."</p>

<p>"She is my sister, Cesare."</p>

<p>"That's a circumstance quite without importance.
Relationship counts for nothing."</p>

<p>She looked at him with an expression of
intense disgust.</p>

<p>"You, then, Cesare," she said, "have no sense
of the greatness of this infamy. She at least,
Laura, the other guilty person, turned pale, was
troubled, trembled with passion and with terror.
You&mdash;no! Here you have been for an hour
absolutely imperturable; not a shade of emotion
has crossed your brazen face; your voice hasn't
changed; you feel no fear, no love, no shame;
you are not even surprised. She at least
shuddered and cried out; she is an Acquaviva!
It is true that, though she saw my anger and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
despair, she had neither pity nor compunction,
but her passion for you, at least, was undisguised.
She had feeling, strength, will. But you&mdash;no.
You, like her, indeed, could see me weep my
heart out, could see me convulsed by the most
unendurable agony, and have not an ounce of
pity for me; but your hardness does not spring,
like hers, from love; no, no; from icy indifference.
You are as heartless as a tombstone. She, at
least, has the courage, the audacity, the effrontery
of her wickedness; she declares boldly that she
loves you, that she adores you, that she will never
cease to love you, that she will always adore you.
She is my sister. In her heart there is the same
canker that is in mine&mdash;a canker from which we
are both dying. You&mdash;no! Love? Passion?
Not even an illusion. Nothing but a harmless
scene of gallantry! A half-hour of amusing
flirtation, without consequence! But what does
it mean, then, to say that we love? Is it a lie
that a man feels justified in telling any woman?
And what is a kiss? A fugitive contact of the
lips, immediately forgotten? So many false
kisses are given in the course of a day and night!
Nonsense, triviality, rubbish! It's bad form to
spy at doors; its exaggeration to call a thing
infamous; it's madness to be jealous. And the
sin that you have committed, instead of originating
in passion, which might in some degree excuse
it, you reduce to an every-day vulgarity, a commonplace
indecency; my sister becomes a vulgar
flirt, you a vulgar seducer, and I a vulgar termagant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
screaming out her morbid jealousy. The
whole affair falls into the mud. My sister's guilty
love, your caprice, my despair, all are in the mud,
among the most disgusting human garbage, where
there is no spiritual light, no cry of sorrow, where
everything is permissible, where the man expires
and the beast triumphs. Do you know what you
are, Cesare?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know. But if you can tell me, I
shall be indebted for the favour."</p>

<p>"You are a man without heart, without conscience;
a soul without greatness and without
enthusiasm; you are a lump of flesh, exhausted
by unworthy pleasures and morbid desires. You
are a ruin, in heart, in mind, in senses; you belong
to the class of men who are rotten; you fill me
with fright and with pity. I did not know that I
was giving my hand to a corpse scented with
heliotrope, that I was uniting my life to the
mummy of a gentleman, whose vitiated senses
could not be pleased by a young, beautiful, and
loving wife, but must crave her sister, her pure,
chaste, younger sister! Have you ever loved,
Cesare? Have you ever for a moment felt the
immensity of real love? In your selfishness you
have made an idol of yourself, an idol without
greatness. A thing without viscera, without
pulses, without emotion! You are corrupt, perverted,
depraved, even to the point of betraying
your wife who adores you, with her sister whom
you do not love! Ah, you are a coward, a
dastard; that's what you are, a dastard!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>She wrung her hands and beat her temples,
pacing the room as a madwoman paces her cell.
But not a tear fell from her eyes, not a sob issued
from her breast.</p>

<p>He stood still, his face impenetrable; not one
of her reproaches had brought a trace of colour to
it. She threw herself upon a sofa, exhausted;
but her eyes still burned and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>"Now that you have favoured me with so
amiable a definition of myself," said he, "permit
me to attempt one of you."</p>

<p>His tone was so icy, he pronounced the words
so slowly, that Anna knew he was preparing a
tremendous insult. Instinctively, obeying the
blind anger of her love, she repeated, "You are
a dastard; that's what you are, a dastard."</p>

<p>"My dear, you are a bore&mdash;that's what <em>you</em>
are."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" she asked, not understanding.</p>

<p>"You're a bore, my dear."</p>

<p>The insult was so atrocious, that for the first
time in the course of their talk her eyes filled with
tears, and a sigh burst from her lips&mdash;lips that
were purple, like those of a dying child. It
seemed as if something had broken in her heart.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a bore. I don't employ high-sounding
words, you see. I speak the plain truth.
You're a bore."</p>

<p>Another sigh, a sigh of insupportable physical
pain, as if the hard word <em>bore</em> had cut her flesh,
like a knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"You flatter yourself that you're a woman of
grand passions," he went on, after looking at his
watch, and giving a little start of surprise to see
how much time he had wasted here. "No? You
flatter yourself that you're a creature of impulse,
a woman with a fate, a woman destined to a tragic
end; and to satisfy this notion, you complicate
and embroil and muddle up your own existence,
and mortally bore those who are about you. With
your rhetoric, your tears, your sobs, your despair,
your interminable letters, your livid face and your
gray lips, you're enough to bore the very saints in
heaven."</p>

<p>He pretended not to see her imploring eyes,
which had suddenly lost their anger, and were
craving mercy.</p>

<p>"Remember all the stupidities you've committed
in the past four or five years," he went on,
"and all the annoyance you've given us. You
were a handsome girl, rich, with a good name.
You might have married any one of a dozen men
of your own age, your own rank, gentlemen, who
were in love with you. That would have been
sensible, orderly; you would have been as happy
as happy can be. But what! Anna Acquaviva,
the romantic heroine, condescend to be happy!
No, no. That were beneath her! So you had to
fancy yourself in love with a beggar whom you
couldn't marry."</p>

<p>She made a gesture, as if to defend Giustino
Morelli.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you really love him? Thanks for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the compliment; you're charming this morning.
Passion, inequality of position, drama, flight into
Egypt, fortunately without a child&mdash;forgive the
impropriety, but it escaped me. Morelli, chancing
to be a decent fellow, Morelli ran away, poor
devil! and our heroine treated herself to the
luxury of a mortal illness. We, Laura, I, everybody,
were bored by the flight, bored by the
illness. The lesson was a severe one, and most
women would have been cured of their inclination
towards the theatrical, as well as of their scarlet
fever. But not so Anna Acquaviva. It didn't
matter to her that she had risked her reputation,
her honour; it didn't matter to her that she had
staked the name of her family; all this only
excited her imagination. And, behold, she begins
her second romance, her second drama, her second
tragedy, and enter upon the scene, to be bored to
death, Signor Cesare Dias!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Holy Virgin, help me," murmured Anna,
pressing her hands to her temples.</p>

<p>"Dramatic love for Cesare Dias, an old man, a
man who has never gone in for passion, who doesn't
wish to go in for it, who is tired of all such bothersome
worries. Anna Acquaviva gives herself up
to an unrequited love, 'one of the most desolating
experiences of the soul'&mdash;that's a phrase I found
in one of your letters. Desolation, torture, spasms,
despair, bitterness, these are the words which our
ill-fated heroine, Anna Acquaviva, employs to depict
her condition to herself and to others. And
Cesare Dias, who had arranged his life in a way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
not to be bored and not to bore anyone, Cesare
Dias, who is an entirely common and ordinary
person, happy in his mediocrity, suddenly finds
himself against his will dragged upon the scene as
hero! He is the man of mysteries, the man who
will not love or who loves another, the superior
man, the neighbour of the stars. And nevertheless
we find a means of boring him."</p>

<p>"Ah, Cesare, Cesare, Cesare!" she said, beseeching
compassion.</p>

<p>"Imbecile ought to be added to the name of
Cesare Dias. That's the title which I best deserve.
Only an imbecile&mdash;and I was one for half-an-hour&mdash;could
have ceded to your sentimental hysterics.
I was an imbecile. But to let you die, to complete
your tragedy of unrequited love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you let me die?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I believe it would have been as well for many
of us. What a comfort for you, dear heroine, to
die consumed by an unhappy passion! Gaspara
Stampa, Properzia de' Rossi, and other illustrious
ladies of ancient times, with whose names you
have favoured me in your letters, would have
found their imitator. I'm sure you would have
died blessing me."</p>

<p>Bowing her head, she sighed deeply, as if she
were indeed dying.</p>

<p>"Instead of letting you die, I went through the
dismal farce of marrying you. And I assure you
that I've never ceased to regret it. I regretted it
the very minute after I'd made you my idiotic
proposal. Ah, well, every man has his moments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of inexplicable weakness, and he pays dearly for
them. And marriage, alas, hasn't proved a sentimental
comedy. With your pretentions to passion,
to love, to mutual adoration, you've bored me
even more than I expected."</p>

<p>"But what, then, is marriage from your point
of view?" she cried.</p>

<p>"A bothersome obligation, when a man marries
a woman like you."</p>

<p>"You would have preferred my sister?" she
asked, exasperated. But she was at once sorry
for this vulgarity; and he speedily punished it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should have preferred your sister. She's
not a bore. I find her extremely diverting."</p>

<p>"She loved you from the beginning," she says.
"A pity she didn't tell you so."</p>

<p>"A pity. I assure you I should have married
her."</p>

<p>"Ah, very well."</p>

<p>But suddenly she raised her eyes to her husband;
and at the sight of that beloved person her
courage failed her. She took his hand, and said,
"Ah, Cesare, Cesare, you are right. But I loved
you, I loved you, and you have deceived me with
my sister."</p>

<p>"Signora Dias, you have rather a feeble
memory," he returned, icily, drawing his hand
away.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you easily forget. We are face
to face; you can't lie. Have I ever told you that
I loved you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;never," she admitted, closing her eyes
agonised to have to admit it.</p>

<p>"Have I ever promised to love you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never."</p>

<p>"Well, then, according to the laws of love, I've
not deceived you, my dear Anna. My heart has
never belonged to you, therefore it's not been taken
from you. I promised nothing, therefore I owe
you nothing."</p>

<p>"It's true. You're right, Cesare," she said;
draining this new cup of bitterness that he had
distilled for her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will speak to me of the laws of
the land. Very good; according to the law a
man and wife are required to be mutually faithful.
A magistrate would say that I had betrayed you.
But consider a little. Make an effort of memory,
Anna, and recall the agreement I proposed to
you that evening at Sorrento, before committing
my grand blunder. I told you that I wished to
remain absolutely free, free as a bachelor; and
you consented. Is it true or not true?"</p>

<p>"It is true. I consented."</p>

<p>"I told you that I would tolerate no interference
on your part with my relations with other
women; and remember, Anna, you consented. Is
that true or untrue?"</p>

<p>"It is true," she said, feeling that she was
falling into an abyss.</p>

<p>"You see, therefore, that neither according to
the laws of love nor according to the laws of
marriage have I betrayed you. And if you had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
a conscience, to adopt your own phraseology, if
you had the least loyalty, you would at once
confess that I have not betrayed you. You
accepted the whole bargain. I am free in heart,
and at liberty to do as I like. I have not
betrayed you. Confess it."</p>

<p>"Cesare, Cesare, be human, be Christian; don't
require me to say that."</p>

<p>"Tragedies are one thing, and truth is another,
Anna. I desire to establish the fact that I
haven't betrayed you, my dear. For what I did
last night, for what I may have done on any
other night, for what I may do any night in the
future, I have your own permission. Confess it."</p>

<p>"I can't say that, do you understand?" she
cried. "Oh, you are always in the right; you
always know how to put yourself in the right.
You are right in your selfishness, in your perfidy,
in your wickedness, in your frightful corruption;
you were right in proposing that disgraceful
bargain to me, which I was not ashamed to
accept, and which you to-day so justly and so
appropriately remind me of. But I believed that
to love, to adore a man as I loved and adored
you, would be a charm to conquer with; and I
have lost. For you are stronger than I; indifference
is stronger than love; selfishness is
stronger than passion. Generous abandonment
cannot overcome the refined calculation of a
corrupt man. I am wrong, I alone, I confess it&mdash;since
I loved you to the point of dying for you,
since I imagined that that was enough, since I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
had in my soul the divine hope of winning you
by my love. I am wrong, I confess it; yes, I
confess it. I cannot love nor hate nor live. I
am nothing but a bore, a superfluous person, and
a tiresome; it is true; it is true. Say it again."</p>

<p>"If you wish it, I will."</p>

<p>"You are right. You are always right. I
have done nothing but blunder. I have always
obeyed the mad impulses of my heart. I fled
from my home. I ought not to have loved you,
and I loved you. I loved you; I have bored
you; and I myself, of my free will, gave you permission
to betray me. You are the most vicious
man I know. You're unredeemed by a thought
or a feeling. You horrify me. Under the same
roof with your wife, you have committed an odious
sin&mdash;a sin that would make the worst men shudder.
And I can't punish you, because I consented to it;
because I debased the dignity of my love before
you; because indeed I am a cowardly and infamous
creature. See how right you are! You
have sinned, but so far as I am concerned you are
innocent. I am infamous and cowardly, because
I ought to have died rather than accept that
loathsome bargain. Forgive me if I have upbraided
you. I'll ask Laura's pardon too. No
human being is soiled with an infamy so great as
mine. Forgive me."</p>

<p>Perhaps he felt in these words the confusion of
madness; perhaps he saw the light of madness in
her eyes. But he was unmoved. She was a
woman who had led him into committing a folly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
who had bored him, and, what was more, who
would like to continue to bore him in the future.
He was unmoved. He was glad to have got the
better of her in this struggle. He was unmoved.
He thought it time to leave her, if he would retain
his advantage.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Anna," he said, rising.</p>

<p>"Don't go away, don't go away," she cried,
throwing herself before him.</p>

<p>"Do you imagine that this duet is pleasing?"
he asked, drawing on his gloves. "For the rest,
we've said all there is to say. I can't think you
have any more insults to favour me with."</p>

<p>"You hate me, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't hate you exactly."</p>

<p>"Don't go away. Don't go away. I must tell
you something very serious."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Anna," he repeated, moving towards
the door.</p>

<p>"Cesare, if you go away, I shall do something
desperate," she cried, convulsively tearing her hair.</p>

<p>"You'd be incapable. To do anything desperate
one must have talent. And you're a fool," he replied,
smiling ironically.</p>

<p>"Cesare, if you go away, I shall die."</p>

<p>"Bah, bah, you'll not die. To die one must have
courage." And he opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>She ran to the threshold. He was already at a
distance. She heard the street door close behind
him. For a few minutes she stood there, fearing
to move lest she should fall; then mechanically
she turned back. She went to her looking-glass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
repaired the disorder of her hair, and put on a
hat, a black veil, and a sealskin cloak. She forgot
nothing. Her pocket-handkerchief was in her
muff; in her hand she carried her card-case of
carved Japanese ivory.</p>

<p>At last she left her room, and entered her
husband's. A servant was putting it in order;
but, seeing his mistress, he bowed and took himself
off. She was alone there, in the big brown
chamber, in the gray winter daylight. She went
to her husband's desk, and sat down before it, as
if she were going to write. But, after a moment's
thought, she did not write. She opened a drawer,
took something from it, and concealed it in her
pocket.</p>

<p>After that, she passed through the house and
out into the street.</p>

<p>She crossed the Piazza Vittoria, and entered
the Villa Nazionale. Children were playing by
the fountain, and she stopped for a moment to
look at them. Twice she made the tour of the
Villa; then she looked at her watch; then she
seated herself on one of the benches. There were
very few people abroad. The damp earth was
covered with dead leaves.</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes upon the dial of her watch,
counting the minutes and the seconds. All at
once she put her hand into her pocket, and felt
the thing that she had hidden there.</p>

<p>Anna rose. It was two o'clock.</p>

<p>She left the Villa, walking towards the Chiatamone.
Before the door of a little house in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Via del Chiatamone she stopped. She hesitated
for a moment; then she lifted the bronze knocker,
and let it fall.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Luigi Caracciolo.</p>

<p>He did not speak. He took her hand, and
drew her into the house.</p>

<p>They crossed two antechambers, hung with
old tapestries, ornamented with ancient and
modern arms, and with big Delft vases filled
with growing palms, a smoking-room furnished
with rustic Swiss chairs and tables, and entered a
drawing-room. The curtains were drawn, the
lamps lighted. The floor and the walls were
covered with Oriental carpets; the room was full
of beautiful old Italian furniture, statues, pictures,
bronzes. There were many flowers about, red
and white roses, subtly perfumed.</p>

<p>Caracciolo took a bunch of roses, and gave
them to Anna.</p>

<p>"Dear Anna&mdash;my dear love," he said.</p>

<p>A faint colour came to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"What is it? Tell me, Anna. Dear one,
dear one!"</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me like that," she said.</p>

<p>"Do I offend you? I can't think that I offend
you&mdash;I who feel for you the deepest tenderness,
the most absolute devotion."</p>

<p>He took her hands.</p>

<p>"It is dark here," she said.</p>

<p>"The day was so sad, the daylight was so
melancholy. I have waited for you so many
hours, Anna."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have come, you see."</p>

<p>"Thank you for having remembered your faithful
servant." And delicately he kissed her gloved hand.</p>

<p>"Why not open the curtains a little?" she asked.</p>

<p>He drew aside his curtains, and let in the
ashen light. She went to the window, and
looked out upon the sea.</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, come away. Somebody might
see you."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"But I can't allow you to compromise yourself,
Anna; I love you too much."</p>

<p>"I have come here to compromise myself," she
said.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you love me a little?" he demanded,
trying to draw her away from the window.</p>

<p>She did not answer. She sat down in an
arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Tell me that you love me a little, Anna."</p>

<p>"I don't love you."</p>

<p>"Dear Anna, dear Anna," he murmured with
his caressing voice, "how can I believe you, since
you are here. Tell me that you love me a little.
For three years I have waited for that word.
Dear Anna, sweet Anna, you know that I have
adored you for so long a time. Anna, Anna!"</p>

<p>"What has happened was bound to happen,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Anna, I conjure you,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> tell me that you love
me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p>She shuddered as she heard him use the familiar
pronoun.</p>

<p>"Do you love me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I know nothing."</p>

<p>"Dear one, dear one," he murmured, trembling
with hope, in an immense transport of love.</p>

<p>He drew nearer to her and kissed her on the
cheek.</p>

<p>A cry of pain burst from her, and she sprang
up, horrified, terrified, and tried to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, for mercy's sake, forgive me. Don't
go away. Anna, Anna, forgive me if I have
offended you. I love you so! If you go away
I shall die."</p>

<p>"People don't die for such slight things."</p>

<p>"People die of love."</p>

<p>"Yes. But one must have courage to die."</p>

<p>"Don't let us talk of these dismal things. My
love, we mustn't talk of things that will sadden
you. Your beautiful face is troubled. Tell me
that you forgive me. Do you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"I forgive you."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. You don't forgive me. You
love another."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;no other."</p>

<p>"And Cesare?"</p>

<p>But scarcely had he spoken the fatal name
when he saw his error. Her eyes blazed; she
trembled from head to foot, in a nervous convulsion.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said. "If you have a heart, if
you have any pity, if you wish me to stay here
with you, never name him again, never name him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right." But then he added, "And
yet you loved him, you love him still."</p>

<p>"No. I love no one any more."</p>

<p>"Why would you not accept me when I proposed
for you?"</p>

<p>"Because."</p>

<p>"Why did you marry that old man?"</p>

<p>"Because."</p>

<p>"And now why do you love him? Why do
you love him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You see, you do love him," he cried in despair.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, oh, God!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am a fool. Forgive me, forgive me.
But I love you, and I lose my head. I love you,
and I am desperate. And I need to know if you
still love him. You will always love him? Is
it so?"</p>

<p>"Till death," she said, with a strange look and
accent.</p>

<p>"Say it again."</p>

<p>"Till death," she repeated, with the same
strange intonation.</p>

<p>They were silent.</p>

<p>Luigi Caracciolo put his arm round her waist,
and drew her slowly towards him.</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed and void. She did not
feel his arms about her. She did not feel his
kisses. He kissed her hair, he kissed her sweet
white throat, he kissed her little rosy ear. Anna
was absorbed in a desperate meditation, far from
all human things. He kissed her face, her eyes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
her lips; she did not know it. But suddenly
she felt his embrace become closer, stronger; she
heard his voice change, it was no longer tender
and caressing, it was fervid with tumultuous
passion, it uttered confused delirious words.
Silently, looking at him with burning eyes, she
tried to disengage herself.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she said.</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, I love you so&mdash;I have loved you
so long!"</p>

<p>"Let me go, let me go!"</p>

<p>"You are my adored one&mdash;I adore you above
all things."</p>

<p>"Let me go. You horrify me."</p>

<p>He let her go.</p>

<p>"But what have you come here for?" he asked,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I have come to commit an infamy."</p>

<p>"Anna, Anna, you are killing me!"</p>

<p>She looked at him fixedly.</p>

<p>"What is it, Anna? Something is troubling
you, and you won't tell me what it is. My poor
friend! You have come here with an anguish in
your heart, wishing to escape from it; you have
come here to weep; and I have behaved like a
brute, a blackguard."</p>

<p>"No, you are good, I shall remember you,"
and she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't go away. Tell me first what it is. Tell
me what you came for. Tell me, dearest Anna."</p>

<p>"It's too long a story, too long," she said, as if
in a dream, passing her hand over her brow. "And
now I must go, I must go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, stop here, talk to me, weep. It will do
you good."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"My minutes are numbered. You'll understand
some day&mdash;to-morrow. Now I must go."</p>

<p>"Anna, how can I let you go like this? You
have come here to be comforted, and I have treated
you shamefully. Forgive me."</p>

<p>"You are not to blame, not in the least."</p>

<p>"But what is it that you are in trouble about,
Anna? Who has been making you miserable,
my poor fond soul? Whose fault is it? Who is
to blame? Cesare?"</p>

<p>"No, I am to blame, I only."</p>

<p>"And Cesare&mdash;you admit it."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Cesare is an infamous scoundrel, and I know
it," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is I who am infamous."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you. I should believe no one
who said that, Anna."</p>

<p>"I must be infamous, since I alone am unhappy.
I must go."</p>

<p>"Will you come back?&mdash;to-morrow? Anna,
you are so sad, you are in such distress, I can't let
you go."</p>

<p>"No one can detain me, no one."</p>

<p>"Anna, forget that I have spoken to you of
love."</p>

<p>"I have forgotten it. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"You musn't go like this. You are too much
agitated."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I am calm. Listen, will you do me a
favour? You repeated some verses to me one
evening at Sorrento&mdash;some French verses&mdash;do you
remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Baudelaire's '<cite>Harmonie du Soir</cite>,'" he
answered, surprised by her question.</p>

<p>"Have you the volume?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Take it, and copy that poem for me. Afterwards
I will say good-bye."</p>

<p>He went into his library and brought back <cite>Les
Fleurs du Mal</cite>. He seated himself at his writing-table,
and looked at Anna. There was an expression
of such immense sorrow in her eyes, that
he faltered, and asked, "Shall I write?"</p>

<p>She bowed her head. While he was writing
the first lines, Anna turned her back to him. She
put her hand into her pocket and brought forth a
little shining object of ivory and steel. He in a
low voice repeated the verse he was writing&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valse
mélancolique et langoureux vertige</i>"&mdash;when
suddenly there was the report of a pistol, and a
little cloud of smoke rose towards the ceiling.</p>

<p>Anna had shot herself through the heart, and
fallen to the floor. Her little gloved hand held
the revolver that she had taken from the drawer of
her husband's desk. Luigi Caracciolo stood rooted
to the carpet, believing that he must be mad.</p>

<p>So died Anna Acquaviva, innocent.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
